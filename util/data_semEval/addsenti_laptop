I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life.##good +1
I bought a HP Pavilion DV4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer.
The tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and I have to direct my concern to the "sales" team, which is the retail shop which I bought my netbook from.
I investigated netbooks and saw the Toshiba NB305-N410BL.
The other day I had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town- lots of people, little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector, etc.
it is of high quality, has a killer GUI, is extremely stable, is highly expandable, is bundled with lots of very good applications, is easy to use, and is absolutely gorgeous.##high +1, stable +1, expandable +1, good +1, easy +1, gorgeous +1
Easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops.##easy +1
Sad very SAD.##sad -1
I even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, iChat, Photobooth, garage band and more!##more +1
Needless to say a PC that can't support a cell phone is less than useless!##useless -1
Great laptop that offers many great features!##great +1, great +1
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem.
One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it, the next day I turn it on, no GUI, screen all dark, power light steady, hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.##no -1, dark -1, steady +1, steady +1
Still pretty pricey, but I've been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund, and finally got to use it.##pricey -1
I took it back for an Asus and same thing- blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset.
In the shop, these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it, get it home, break the seal and use it (very clever con).##soft +1
However, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you're gaming).##unnecessary -1
Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work.##small +1, light +1
I HATE this one.##hate -1
They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place.
Toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done.
Oh, boy!
But while this is one big advantage (as you may know from the company s recent commercials) there are other things to consider before going with Apple.
I love the way the entire suite of software works together.##love +1
The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied.##incredible +1, satisfied +1
on the bright side at least I wasn't without my laptop for long this time!
This laptop meets every expectation and Windows 7 is great!##great +1
That's how frustrating it was.##frustrating -1
I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly.##properly +1
The one down side to it is that when I play a certain game on here, it tends to freeze up sometimes, but thats the only bad thing about this computer.##bad -1
-No backlit keyboard, but not an issue for me.##no -1
When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed.##crashed -1
I can't even turn it off.
One suggestion I do have, is to not bother getting Microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a PC.
Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it's a snap.##pleasure +1, painless +1
I shopped around before buying.
I also got the added bonus of a 30" HD Monitor, which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh!##added bonus +1
Would do business again.
The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.##slow -1, crashes -1
After paying several hundred dollars for this service, it is frustrating that you cannot get help after hours.##frustrating -1
I have had the luxury (sarcasm) of owning 2 of these laptops.
What a waste.##waste -1
It was a total hell experience that I will never repeat.
There are a few flaws as well that I noticed.
Completely worth every single penny dime and nickel.##worth +1
I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem.
I did have to replace the battery once, but that was only a couple months ago and it's been working perfect ever since.##replace -1, perfect +1
:) In the past four years I've had it I have never once gotten a virus.
I love the operating system and the preloaded software.##love +1
They were great in handling this problem, and I'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future.##great +1
I've tried going back to XL but there still problems.
The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features.##best +1, newer +1
After numerous attempts of trying (including setting the clock in BIOS setup directly), I gave up(I am a techie).
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY.##able +1
But it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future.
Has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device.
but now i have realized its a problem with this brand.##problem -1
It cannot save the correct date and time I set.
I sent it back to Toshiba twice they covered it under the  warranty.
And this isn't just my one experience.
They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later.
I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for.
I would highly recommend this one to my friends##recommend +1
I honestly love my mac, thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict.##love +1
And these are some reasons you should get a macbook pro.
Also kinda loud when the fan was running.##loud -1
In desperation, I called their Customer Service number and was told that my warranty had expired (2 days old) and that the privilege of talking to a technician would cost me ("have your credit card ready").
I purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email.
There also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files.##problem -1, able +1
Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down.##ok +1, froze -1
-they lost my laptop for a month
Spent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support.
This is my second laptop,and it is head and shoulders above my first.
at first!
Speaking of the browser, it too has problems.##problems -1
I think just going from PC to Mac has gotten me totally spoiled and I can't imagine ever going back.##spoiled -1
The keyboard is too slick.##slick -1
Nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan.
It's like 9 pounds, but if you can look past it, it's GREAT!##great +1
It's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open.##fast +1
Still under warrenty so called Toshiba, no help at all.##no -1
I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty.##happy +1
I LOVE IT!##love +1
Amazing Quality!##amazing +1
The fact that you can spend over $100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine.##underscores -1
I mainly use it for email, internet, and managing personal files (pics, vids, etc.).
A month or so ago, the freaking motherboard just died.##freaking -1, died -1
The system it comes with does not work properly, so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all.##properly +1
Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.##stopped -1
I took it back to Best Buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one.##helpful +1
If you had PC for four years I can almost guarantee that something would of gone wrong by now, maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer.##wrong -1, replace -1
*2 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Called headquarters, they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is "on the top of the stack".
This machine delivers.
Then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro.
I complain again...
This laptop is insane!!!##insane +1
If a website ever freezes (which is rare), its really easy to force quit.##easy +1
It does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern.
It rarely works and when it does it's incredibly slow.##slow -1
I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program.##enjoy +1
It's so much easier to navigate through the operating system, to find files, and it runs a lot faster!##easier +1, faster +1
Purchased a Toshiba Lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out.##good +1
I always swore by PCs and would never consider a MAC.
what an elegant, wonderful machine.##elegant +1, wonderful +1
This is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it!##love +1
for 2 months.
I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble.##refused -1
Do you ever think HP would do that? NEVER!
We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed.##increase +1
It's not like I have used for half a year and then complained about it.
Still trying to learn how to use it.
The reality was, it heated up very quickly, and took way too long to do simple things, like opening my Documents folder.##quickly +1, long -1
I bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around.##smaller +1, lighter +1
The Genius at the Apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure.
We'll save our money to replace it with a Mac again!
Thank you for your great product!##great +1
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this "never" happen...##horrible -1
I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive.##frustrated -1, crashing -1, poorly -1, intuitive +1
Sorry Toshiba, but 1st impressions do count for something.
Then, within 5 months, the charger crapped out on me.##crapped -1
And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed.##high +1
Overall this laptop is great.##great +1
I love the glass touchpad.##love +1
I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again.##replaced -1
I am using the external speaker- sound is good.##good +1
The Apple MC371LL/A 2.4Ghz 15.4-inch MacBook Pro Notebook is a horrible waste of money.##horrible -1
Ok, this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple.##best +1
As of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom,,,about 4 inches across is hardly visible.
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better, but am very happy with the upgrade.##better +1, happy +1
Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up, not able to connect.##screwed up -1
I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I won't have to worry about a crash.
Oh yeah, don't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP.##expensive -1
I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express.##recommend +1
Good luck.
Everything is so easy to use, Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software.##easy +1, simpler +1
My favorite by far, although the most expensive, was my Sony.##favorite +1, expensive -1
And if you do a lot of writing, editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key.##problem -1, no -1
Also I typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying.##annoying -1
As an owner of a Toshiba Satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy.
Its ease of use and the top service from Apple- be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar- cannot be beat.##ease +1, top +1, genius +1, cannot be beat +1
It has a 10 hour battery life when you're doing web browsing and word editing, making it perfect for the classroom or office, and in terms of gaming and movie playing it'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours.##perfect +1
I shipped out on Saturday, July 17.
I bought it for really cheap also and it's AMAZING.##cheap +1, amazing +1
Acer has set me up with FREE recovery discs, when they are available since I asked.##free +1
I also purchased Office Max's "Max Assurance" with the "no lemon" clause.
If you find yourself in the market for a new laptop (and have the money) don't exclude looking at the MBPs.
I eventually did the migration from my iMac backup disc which uses USB.
Those things are very important - vital even!
-They say it will take "up to two weeks".
I didn't like one thing about it.##like +1
The battery life seems to be very good, and have had no issues with it.##good +1
Enabling the battery timer is useless.##useless -1
Temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in Core Processing Unit temperatures.##alright +1
Yeah, to you.
I got a mac as my HS graduation gift.
I have now had it for 1.5 months and love it.##love +1
It turned out it's not really a problem to have a Mac.
Page just disappeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something.
Images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode.
Going to bring it to service today.
There is no need to purchase virus protection for Mac, which saves me a lot of time and money.##saves +1
But we had paid for bluetooth, and there was none.##none -1
So, I paid a visit to LG notebook service center at Alexandra Road, hoping they can make the hinge tighter.
My daughter uses it for games, email, facebook, pictures and music.
Laptop is to be used like a Netbook.
It is always reliable, never bugged and responds well.##reliable +1, bugged -1, well +1
After about a week I finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard.##failed -1, new +1
Trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything, so I want to manage my time I do have to be the most efficient.##efficient +1
It was slow, locked up, and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months!##slow -1, replaced -1
they had to replace the motherboard in April##replace -1
Yes, the computer was light weight, less expensive than the average laptop, and was pretty self explanatory in use.##light +1, less expensive +1, explanatory +1
Also, if you need to talk to a representative at Microsoft, there is a charge, which I believe is robbery, since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system, which most people would have went with XP if they could.##enormous -1, badly -1
There is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that.
I love WIndows 7 which is a vast improvment over Vista.##love +1, vast +1
Also, I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot, and not even sitting on anything to make it hot.
It Was a great deal after all.##great +1
This mac is great!##great +1
Keyboard is great, very quiet for all the typing that I do.##great +1, quiet +1
I grew up in a design family so it only made sense.
Gave phone number.
It would take up too much time to do research for my papers and I would be up hours - just because the computer was too slow.##slow -1
Oh my goodness - I am not a happy camper.
Dell's customer disservice is an insult to it's customers who pay good money for shoddy products.##insult -1, good +1, shoddy -1
I'd recommend this laptop to anyone!##recommend +1
Yet, HP won't do anything about the problem.
i'm returning mine
It had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use, and would not move past this error.
I can render AVCHD movies with little effort, which was a problem for most pc's unless you had a quad core I7.##problem -1
It's a bummer and one out of five is being kind.
This is what they told me: It heats up, and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops, and simply categorize them as portables.
After talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate, I chose the MacBook Pro over the white MacBook.##knowledgeable +1
If you really want a bang-up system and don't need to run Windows applications, go with an Apple;##bang-up +1
You won't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet.##inefficient -1

One of them seems to have worked.
Which I still use and have hooked up to my TV.
The problem I had with this unit was unresolvable.##unresolvable -1
It weighed like seven pounds or something like that.
2 months later, the battery went.
You may need to special order a bag.
It's color is even cool.##cool +1
and it has blue screen crashed on me twice.
Another two weeks later and it was back in my possession.
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed.##weird -1, large -1
I've owned every "Pro" model Apple laptop for the last 8 years, this is BY FAR the WORST one I've ever had.##worst -1

I'm pleased.##pleased +1
The keyboard feels good and I type just fine on it.##good +1, fine +1
With a healthy pessimism, I took the machine home and tried to find a flaw.
Shiny This Laptop is the Best of the best!##best +1
I thought the white Mac computers looked dirty too quickly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing.##dirty -1
And not to mention after using it for a few months or so, the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you can't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying.##less -1
Don't waste their money, save it and but a mac.
Money and time well spent!##well +1
Gradually the freezing screen evolved into a screen that froze in weird shapes.##froze -1, weird -1

I now travel with this laptop and my work PC.
I am however pleased that it is still hanging in there.##pleased +1
Both my husband and I have this model Toshiba.
no complaints with their desktop, and maybe because it just sits on your desktop, and you don't carry it around, which could jar the hard drive, or the motherboard.##jar -1
Yes, they cost more, but they more than make up for it in speed, construction quality, and longevity.##more -1, make up +1
Since I keyboard over 100 wpm, I look for a unit that has a comfortable keyboard (no keys sticking or lagging, strange configuration of "extra key", etc.##comfortable +1, no +1, strange -1
) I also tried the touch pad and compared it to other netbooks in the store.
It absolutely is more expensive than most PC laptops, but the ease of use, security, and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag.##more expensive -1, ease +1, well worth +1
It gets stuck all of the time you use it, and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work.##stuck -1
lots of preloaded software.##lots +1
Sony, Acer, Dell, Packard Bell and Toshiba.
and then, a guy came out to serve me instead.
Breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4+ people to report the damaged part will be returned late!
Have returned that laptop unused.
Will probably never buy a HP again.
I got tired of buying laptops and having them stop working after a year.
I should have been more observant.
I wish it had a webcam though, then it would be perfect!##perfect +1
My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen.##favorite +1
Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent.##excellent +1
One drawback, I wish the keys were backlit.##drawback -1
When the buyer returned it Wal Mart just boxed it, taped it shut resold it as new.
What a great little laptop.##great +1
Acer was no help and Garmin could not determine the problem(after spending about 2 hours with me), so I returned it and purchased a Toshiba R700 that seems even nicer and I was able to load all of my software with no problem.##nicer +1, no problem +1
I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month.##louder +1, break -1

It caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours.##wiped out -1
WOULD PAY MORE FOR IT IF I HAD TOO!
Couldn't keep a page up you were working on!
It is everything I'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy.##sturdy -1
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safari but after i install Mozilla firefox i love every single bit about it.##like +1, love +1

I've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory.##impressed +1, small +1
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one.
I'm extremely happy with my purchase as I now have the portable power I have been looking for.##happy +1
It's applications are terrific, including the replacements for Microsoft office.##terrific +1
they improved nothing else such as Resolution, appearance, cooling system, graphics card, etc.##nothing -1
I got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime I touched the lid, (mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed) but I suffered thru it and would constantly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out.##shorting out -1, suffered -1
Is this partially due to the fact that it is running Windows Vista?
You might think, I am new in this game, but I am a gadget lover, and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years, and none gets this hot, that fast.
I was informed that I need to call some 0900 number first.
I really wanted a Mac over a pc because I used a Mac in high school.

Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user's liking.##liking +1
It is held in place magnetically.

It is easy to use and lightweight.##easy +1
I went to Toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it.
It is a bit heavy.##heavy -1
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me.
They also have a longer service life than other computers (I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks).##longer +1

In the three years I've had my MacBook Pro, I have never had a virus on my computer, and I do a lot of work on the internet.
I was ready to take it back for a refund, but the Geek Squad came through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed.
I have had laptops in the past and I thought why not give these small netbooks a try.
It can't get any better.##better +1
All the problems I have had with PC's are solved with a Mac: the issue of overheating - my Dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off, and the issue of viruses and contaminants - my HP completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it, with no inexpensive way of fixing it.
only good thing is the graphics quality.##good +1
The other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes, the most common being a corrupted version of Appleworks which can render the browser useless.##corrupted -1, useless -1
In short I would never buy a Compaq again.
I love the 15" MacBook Pro.##love +1
breaks easily.
The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual.##easily -1, farther back -1
That's right, no power, absolutely NOTHING.##no -1, nothing -1
I had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was.
The store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they don't even recommend the HP brand because of the problems with their warranty.##honored +1, recommend +1
But I was wrong.
NO good.##good +1
I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times.
They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer, they paid postage and whatnot, but when I got my computer back it still wasn't running right, and now my CD drive wasn't reading anything!##right +1
I bought this laptop Was the worst Laptop I've ever bought.##worst -1
But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing.##bad -1
Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds.
On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I didn't like the trackpad.##like +1
This computer doesn't do that well with certain games it can't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.##well +1, hot -1
Obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the "human interface.##most important +1
Yeah, of course smarty pants "fix it now")Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple (which I promptly did).##crashing -1, smarty +1
The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up.##cheaply made -1

The Apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you :)##nicely +1
Summary: Dont buy HP.
I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista, yet I know Vista isn't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista (I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system).##problem -1
The video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they update the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better.##iffy -1, better +1
You'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them.
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one.##hard -1, hassle -1
That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.##ridiculous -1, cheaper +1
Macs are designed for the "frontal lobe challenged" people out there.
Fan vents to the side, so no cooling pad needed, great feature!##no +1, great +1
i use my mac all the time, i love the software, the way it takes a short time to load things, how easy it is to use and most of all how you don't have to worry about viruses.##love +1, short +1, easy +1
Wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time.##wasted -1
It has far exceeded my expectations for power, storage, and ability.##exceeded +1
A great feature is the spotlight search: one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword, rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document.##great +1
My wireless system would not recognize Windows 7 and I couldn't get online to find out why.
I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great!##enjoying +1, great +1
It is the worst laptop ever##worst -1
Suffice it to say, my MacBook Pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed.##long +1, blazing +1
I'm not going to lie, I've never really liked the Acer brand in general.##like +1
The OS is also very user friendly, even for those that switch from a PC, with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS!##user friendly +1

Would buy 100 more of these if I could.
while it was barely a bargin in the begining, i would never purchase another dell and would not recomend the dell brand to others.##recomend +1
it was shooting sparks!
Great product.##great +1
Mac is not made for gaming.
Well I spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model, which gets hot and the battery doesn't make it through 1 DVD.##hot -1
I've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful, english speaking (from Vancouver) techs that walked me through the processes to help me.##wonderful +1, helpful +1
But Sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars.
By this time I was regretting ever SEEING this machine on the shelf!
Toshiba is a great brand, even though I haven't had it for a long time, I am very happy with it!##great +1, happy +1
I need graphic power to run my Adobe Creative apps efficiently.##efficiently +1
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm.##easy +1, quick +1, charm +1
The materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere.##right +1
So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand.
That day!
" For one, I noticed that from turning on my mac to logging on only took about 25 seconds.
It does not even have the software to play a dvd now.
My brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an Apple.
Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again.##problem -1
Since I never really got to use this, I can't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them.
Buyers beware.
HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK!!!
Sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size.##sacrificing -1
I'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba.
upon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told, was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired.##out of -1
Windows XP SP2 caused many problems on the computer, so I had to remove it.##problems -1
Love it.##love +1
I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate, and the Bluetooth and Fingerprint reader (software) would not load.

Oh, it is such a great piece of equipment.##great +1
this is my second one and the same problem, bad video card unreliable overall, this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy.##bad -1, unreliable -1
I use that alot on my desktop, so I am adjusting to not having it.
With awesome graphics and assuring security, it's perfect!##awesome +1, assuring +1, perfect +1
Laptop was in new condition and operational, but for the audio problem when 1st sent for repair.##operational +1

It runs perfectly.##perfectly +1
Very disappointed becase I have had toshibas for years, and never a issue.##disappointed -1
If you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac!
The laptop was very easy to set up.##easy +1

I would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one.##recommend +1
I recommend for word processing and internet users.##recommend +1
Since I've had this computer I've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.##nice +1, smooth +1
When the computer has been on for several minutes, it will occasionaly just go off by itself.
A longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it's spec quite easily.##longer +1, great +1, easily +1
Who couldn't love a DVD burner, 80-gigabyte HD, and fairly new graphics chip? As I soon discovered, though, there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more: they use higher-quality components that are faster, better-configured, and end up lasting a lot longer.##love +1, new +1, higher-quality +1, faster +1, better-configured +1, longer +1
falls into the case.
This is something i would deffinately recommend to someone.##recommend +1
Its fast and another thing I like is that it has three USB ports.##fast +1, like +1
Mac computers automatically "defrag" each time you start your computer.
That is my only complaint!
The salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it.##problems -1, happy +1
That system is fixed.##fixed +1
The computer itself was fast, ran smoothly, and had no problems.##fast +1, smoothly +1
One of the smartest thing I did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase.
Like the price and operation.##like +1
The brand is tarnished in my heart.##tarnished -1
This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.##poor -1, fixed +1, better +1
Honestly, this is absolutely wonderful.##wonderful +1
I 'have had it for about a 1 1/2 and yes I have had an issue with it one month out of warranty.##out of -1
I really wish I had done this years ago.
Well, maybe I was just very unlucky.
For example, when my husband turns the light out while I'm on the computer.
Once open, the leading edge is razor sharp.##razor sharp -1
Loaded with bloatware.
If you buy, pray you dont have major problems.
Don't get me wrong, I am no Microsoft hater, I've just managed to turn into a much bigger Apple fan because of this machine.
HP refused to give me a new one and Wal Mart refused to take it back.
Within 3 weeks the same issues started happening AGAIN.
Maximum sound isn't nearly as loud as it should be.##loud +1
Well, they don't care a bunch.
I loaded windows 7 via Bootcamp and it works flawlessly!##flawlessly +1

I would recommend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school.##recommend +1
I would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a Desktop it does not meet the expectations.##recommend +1
The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.##nice +1, great +1
So what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool? The after sales support is terrible.##chic +1, cool +1, terrible -1
they have not sent a new one nor called.
I would easly recommend this laptop to a friend.##recommend +1
I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it.##hate -1
I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare.
I also like the acer arcade but these were really the only two things I liked about this laptop.##like +1, liked +1
Have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing, which is leaps and bounds ahead of PC in my opinion.##great +1
Thinking about returning it
I gave it to my daughter because I just hated the screen, hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd's when I wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork.##hated -1, hated -1, no -1
It runs very quiet too which is a plus.##quiet +1, plus +1
but it has a major design flaw.##flaw -1

this computer will last you at least 7 years, thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.##amazing +1
I bought mine from Apple Store the day it was released as Amazon didn't have it yet.

however, I may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton.
Love it so far.##love +1
It is so much easier to use##easier +1
There is no need to open a program first and the click open or import.##no need +1

The computer is so slow, even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up.##slow -1
I feel that enough people have Macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be.
The price premium is a little much, but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash.##much -1, worth +1

Now for the hardware problems.##problems -1
Unfortunately, that is not the case.

I worked in IT retail sales before.
Features like the font are very block-like and old school.##block-like -1, old -1
It has everything you need to get the job done.

DO NOT BUY GATEWAY COMPUTERS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS HORRIBLE.##junk -1, horrible -1

I liked the aluminum body.##liked +1
also it is light weight compared to others.##light +1
Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies.##good +1
From the build quality to the performance, everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple.##sub-par -1
I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program, and the program will simply open that file.##love +1
Sorry, newegg.

Originally bought it for my wife.
It was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax.##great +1, less +1

I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it!##love +1

There are several programs for school or office use (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc.), music (Garageband), photo management (Photo Booth, iPhoto), video-editing or movie-making (iMovie), etc.
This is my 3rd Apple Laptop and first MacBook Pro.
I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied.##satisfied +1
The love part of my relationship with this laptop doesn't take very long.##love +1, long -1
Not enough time for me to give it 5 stars!
The screen shows great colors.##great +1
Reason why? It's because when you buy it, you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop, the price will stay the same for the next year, and even if Apple does decides to change mode, your laptop value will only drop 10-20%, unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80%.
That's a huge difference.
Dells are ok, HPs aren't that good, but Macs are Fantastic.##ok +1, good +1, fantastic +1
So, buyers beware!
I am totally satisfied with my little toshiba!##satisfied +1
I have no idea how to burn cd's or to use the web cam, just for starters.
Again, I sent it off to Acer, by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything, but it was still inconvenient because of my classes and my communication with my fiance.##inconvenient -1

Do I like the computer? Well, other than not getting viruses, I guess it is OK.##like +1, ok +1
For the Bluetooth to work properly, you must install the Launch Manager on the Drivers/Applications DVD, or it will not show after the reload.##properly +1
I waited and waited and no laptop.
Everything is falling apart internally and externally.
I also liked the glass screen.##liked +1
The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop.##sweet +1
It super shiny, so you can see the fingerprints easily.##shiny +1, easily +1
It's not a wear-and-tear issue, not due to user carelessness and most importantly, they CAN'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and I have to accept the outcome.
The battery life has not decreased since I bought it, so i'm thrilled with that.##decreased -1, thrilled +1
Its a dog plain and simple.
When I called Toshiba, they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $35 for the phone call, even though they didn't offer any technical support.

Just don't waste your time and money on this.
All I will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap Vaio.##less expensive +1, better +1

And I'm still paying the bloody financing, for a product which didn't last me at least three years !
Games being the main issue.##issue -1
No problems, no lock ups, no disappointments.
While the computer seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak, there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the PC world.##crazy -1
I am definitely sold, and not going back to PCs for home use!

They definitely have a superior product!##superior +1
A great computer for light home use and business use.##great +1, light +1
Bought it to use mostly for online classes.
Even with virus protection, it always turned off when updates were needed and installed.
Also consider the MS Office apps are all trial versions, hope you have your own copies.
They are wonderful, but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat.##wonderful +1, dangerous -1
This computer was awful!##awful -1

Hopefully Amazon will take this back.
They ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months!
I'm still within the one year warranty but the repair "depot"  has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered.
But I needed a laptop for school use.

Theres a built in camera with special effects- for video and photography.##special +1
All for such a great price.##great +1
I went right out and purchased another laptop.
Long story short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crappy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.##crappy -1
I am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it.##able +1, fine +1
I already own an iPhone, and so the move just made more sense.
So think about factoring those things in when you purchase.
Took the netbook on a vacation trip and I was able to do whatever I wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop.
Everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing.
This computer gets very hot, before shutting down.##hot -1
Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it.##broke -1

They said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty, and that products with extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not Sony itself anymore.
It's so useable and responsive.##useable +1, responsive +1
It is truly a Desktop Replacement.
I only used it to browse the internet and and I dont know how many times it has spontaneously shut down and it is just a blank screen now.
A little pricey but it is well, well worth it.##pricey -1, well +1, well worth +1
Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings).##long-life +1

Just what the doctor ordered.
If you don't feel comfortable doing it yourself, just buy the case and be happy, plus it looks nice, I bought the white one from Best Buy.##happy +1, nice +1
The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter.
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price, but you cannot find the look, easy, applications, and the experience in mac.##better +1, lower +1, easy +1
Excellent speed for processing data.##excellent +1
All in all, I'm incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop, and with HP as a whole.##dissatisfied -1
I am not happy at all with the product I purchased.##happy +1
When you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing.

This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.
Obviously we both got new Macs.

They said it was a computer error on this type of computer.
I will never buy another computer from Dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how I was treated by the company.##awful -1
My review mainly talks about the difference I have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro.
That was a big mistake.
The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions!##problem -1, lack -1
Small enough to use on a long flight, Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips.##small +1, light +1, powerful +1
Typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on.##uncomfortable -1, sharp -1
If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS!!!
It has many great programs, such as ILife, iPhotos and others.##great +1
Other Thoughts: Received replacement 16 Days later.
If the number of patrons in the Apple store are any indication, HP and other PC manufacturers need to take note.
The processor went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went.
I bought my first MacBook after seeing the product demonstrated.
It is very well built.##well +1
Might not make the avid gamer happy but I don't really think that is what this computer is designed for.##happy +1
I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door.##recommend +1, great +1
The screen resolution was exactly what I was looking for.##exactly +1
Even though it is running Snow Leopard, 2.4 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running Office Mac applications such as Word or Excel.##antiquated -1, occasional -1
seriously why haven't they just replaced it by now.
There is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer.##no -1, bummer -1
After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off.
If upgrade is possible to the full Windows 7, then I will truly be a very happy geek.##happy +1
I have used both PCs and Macs and I have to say that I really really love my Mac Book Pro.##love +1
I was originally concerned that I couldn't view work I had done in college on my Mac because of the PC formatting, but I was even more thrilled to learn of programs like iLife and iWork that allow you to convert your PC documents into readable files on Macs.##thrilled +1
It is a big big, but since it has a 18.4" screen what would you expect!##big +1
I have never had an experience like this.
We haven't had any problems with it at all.
returned it to walmart.
10 hours of battery life is really something else....
I love everything about it.##love +1
It's slow and one day i hope to have the money to get rid of it and buy something else.##slow -1
It meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling.
Runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better.##fast +1, better +1
All was well.##well +1
All the programs are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro, it is clean and organized, which I always strive to be myself.##easy +1, straight forward +1, clean +1, organized +1
He said quite a number of people had encountered this problem and said it is a common issue.##problem -1, issue -1
Not worth it one bit.##worth +1
I just can't fathom that the celebrated Dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs.
Much of which HP ended up paying for.
I reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again.##good +1
Windows 7 Starter is terrific (no you can't change the background) but I don't need to, I use it just for school work.##terrific +1
Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund.##lackluster -1
First of all, they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty I'd paid almost $400 for, and I had to call in, spend hours on their online chat service, and fax in multiple documents.
I hate to say this, but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then I would.##hate -1
It makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier.##easier +1
Being only 2 months old, I am not a happy camper!
">  iPhoto is probably the best program I have ever worked with: easy and convenient.##best +1, easy +1, convenient +1
I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both!##love +1, great +1
THis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse.##small -1
They would repair one thing, send it back and it would still have the same problem.
Such as PAGES, NUMBERS, and so on.
My laptop now has no battery.##no -1
Beta had better quality, but VHS became the industry standard.##better +1
It made the computer much easier to use and navigate.##easier +1
:-)If you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.##satisfied +1
Needs longer lasting battery, More than 1 to 2 Hrs.##longer +1
in May I started having problems with the USB ports not working.##problems -1
10 plus hours of battery...
If only Bill Gates would read some of what is said here MS would do a better job.##better +1
The design is awesome, quality is unprecedented.##awesome +1, unprecedented +1
I'm going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible.
The Mac version of Microsoft Office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well.##cheaper +1, well +1
The Mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average PC, but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use.
Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action.
The Toshiba Net book operates very well.##well +1
I loved it.##loved +1
the touch pad is fine - again, it's a real touch pad.##fine +1, real +1
The pictures are clear as can be.##clear +1
It is also very lightweight, making transporting this computer very easy.##easy +1
If anything, I would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to.
I sit down and use my husband's work PC and I don't like it one bit.##like +1
It's wonderful for computer gaming.##wonderful +1
You have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability.
AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer (when they have a certain promotion/offer going, of course)!##best +1, free +1
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one.
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the macbook pro notebook.##easy +1
I like it better than my big Dell Laptop.##better +1
The flaws are, this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X.##flaws -1
I tried giving it 0 stars but I had to choose at least one, but IMO NO STARS
They really do have the worlds very worst repair service.##worst -1
They need to stop outsourcing and send some complaint calls to US based customer service agents for those who live in the United states.
I was also able to install and use my Photoshop and After Effects programs easily.##able +1, easily +1
It's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc!##perfect +1, faster +1
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is.##small +1, amazing +1, fast +1
Heck, I like all Mac computers, but they're all WAY too pricey for the kind of economy the U.S. is going through.##like +1, pricey -1
Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.
They claim that I should be happy because I am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop.##happy +1
I'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown.##sleek +1
The machine itself is alright.##alright +1
It seems to have some options that are installed but do not work like I thought they would.
And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare.##worse nightmare -1
I will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when I do so I don't run accross a situation like this again!##issues -1
I also experience the same with my MacBook Air.
It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer.##necessary +1
I have owned many different brands of laptops in my life.
I did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this laptop.
I've owned this labtop for less then two months, already the mouse button has broke.##broke -1
It did fairly well, other than it's poor performance, overheating and occational blue screen.##well +1, poor -1
The touchpad is very intuitive, so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again!##intuitive +1
tons of bloatware and junk programs.##junk -1
its sad because their commercials are great.##great +1
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small.##lots +1, small -1
Luckily, Dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one, but instead I got a refund and bought a mac.
I decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it.
Never been hacked.
It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something.##bad -1
Good keyboard, long battery life, largest hard drive and windows 7.##good +1, long +1, largest +1
I think it was seventy nine plus tax.
In summary, take your money elsewhere.
The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications.##quick +1, effective +1
My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars!##bad -1
I will NEVER buy (Refurbished) again, I don't care how cheap it is.##cheap +1
It pretty much does everything we could ever need, and looks great to boot.##great +1
It is just slow slow slow.##slow -1
Bottom line, I doubt you'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine.##disappointed -1
As a lifelong Windows user, I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac.##pleased +1
So, owing to these problems, I went out and got myself an Apple MacBook Pro, which I am using with great satisfaction at this very moment.##great satisfaction +1
The Macbook Pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy Windows Laptop.##thin +1, light +1, heavy -1
So this was great for me.##great +1
This is the first macbook I have ever had.
The acer one computer is a great computer.##great +1
another problem.
The Macbook is also made better, my computer has never got a virus, and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day I bought it.##better +1, fast +1
So, if you're thinking of a laptop, I would heartily recommend the Apple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer (Z0J80001) Notebook for all your needs!##recommend +1
I wiped nearly everything off of it, installed OpenOffice and Firefox, and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price.##efficient +1, useful +1, great +1
Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality, had poor performance, although it did have great battery life when it did work.##poor -1, poor -1, great +1
I picked it out because it was inexpensive ($400) and I thought it would be a good, easy to use first laptop.##inexpensive +1, good +1, easy +1
MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG. THE PRODUCT KEY.##problem -1
The "Time remaining" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.
Pay attention to the specs if you want these options.
Stupidly, mind-numbingly slow--then I found it can only be loaded with 2GB *maximum*.
It also does not have bluetooth.
Sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer.##best +1
I can do pretty much 75% of what I do on my desktop on my kitchen table.
Being a PC user my whole life....
great battery life.##great +1
The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it's speed.##stand out +1
At first, the computer seemed a great deal--seemingly high-end specs for a low, low price.##great +1, high-end +1, low +1
Delivery was early too.##early +1
During that time, I had to send it back 3 times.
Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro, this thing holds its own.
Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system.##love +1
And that probably explains why I've already had my SATA controller go bad within a year of buying it.
I left the place angrily.
I my wife is also now the proud owner of a Macbook as well!
I've had a Toshiba laptop in the past;
It's also very capable of doing moderate video editing (although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing).##capable +1
ASUS said my netbook was working properly.##properly +1
I received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst.##worst -1
Very annoying.##annoying -1
My main reason to convert was the imovie program.
It has a faster processor and more ram.##faster +1, more +1
If you need an affordable, entry-level laptop, this will fit the bill.##affordable +1
Laptops are usually used on the go, so why not give you a better battery?##better +1
I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar.##complain -1, worth +1
I wasn't a big fan of the Netbooks but this one was very well designed.##well +1
It may take a little getting used to but you don't have to worry about viruses or other headaches.
And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles.
I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to!##stupid -1
Would like more trendy, high tech features.##like +1, trendy +1, high tech +1
Keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable.##great +1, durable +1
Screen is a bit glossy, but that's not too bad.##glossy -1, bad -1
Received the product promptly and without any issues.##promptly +1, issues -1
It is so great, I can Hardly ever take my hands off it!##great +1
I remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever I look at the small scratch that it has caused.
I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced, so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months.##replaced -1
But reasons we chose this Apple computer.
Processor - When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance (2.3 GHz v/s 2.4 GHz).
They say it could be the motherboard again, but Dell
I upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop.##amazed +1, slower -1
2nd Best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgrade patches to make less easier for people to hack into##best +1, best +1, less easier +1
Love the speed, especially!##love +1
It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3.##perfect +1, faster +1
Not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved, worked on and opened on both a PC and Mac, the versions of these programs on a Mac are graphically and functionally superior.##able +1, superior +1
By Air sounds more like by truck to Me.
So far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and I am PRAYING it has finally stopped.
It's outstanding too.##outstanding +1
The speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly, and multiple at a time if you so wish.##seamlessly +1
Awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college.##awesome +1, perfect +1
So I'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority.##disappointed -1
A MONTH LATER, we reinstall the OS (Vista).
Some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software, but there is no guarantee.##problems -1
My real problem with it? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie.##problem -1
just chill and enjoy.##chill +1, enjoy +1
The battery life is also relatively good.##good +1
It is her first laptop and she is thrilled.##thrilled +1
I should have sent it back to them then.
I definitely suggest getting an extended warranty, you will probably need it!##suggest +1
If this would be your first Mac purchase then I would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between Mac and PC's.##suggest +1
This laptop leaves alot to be desired, I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice...##desired +1
I have found it very easy to use, very informative, wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs.##easy +1, informative +1, easy +1, various +1
I don't have stupid pop up windows (even when I have pop ups blocked), I don't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download, and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down.##stupid -1, best +1
I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room;
Don't waste your money or time.
It has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here.
Memory is upgradable.##upgradable +1
Web access through the 3G network is so slow, it's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.##slow -1, frustrating -1, disappointing -1
Well, I bought this laptop a month or two ago.
My MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment.##disappointment -1
Received all four in good order;##good +1
The computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it.
this is starting off good.##good +1
The large screen also helps when you are working in design based programs like Adobe Creative Suite.##large +1
The only pro to this computer is it was under $600!
Moral of the story:-Do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers.
This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!##lacking -1
As well as having the plug in the computer come loose.##loose -1
Very small and portable I've had this netbook about 12 hrs now and It's better than expected.##small +1, portable +1, better +1
She said Wal Mart rants and raves abouy carring Dell because it's a big name but they are a piece of garbage.
NOT WITH APPLE.
After 3 pleasant weeks of use, the laptop just died.##pleasant +1, died -1
Each time taking about 1 day or so.
Second HDD cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one.##broken -1
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications.
So a couple of years later, I was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet.
This netbook went bad on me after 3 days.
Probably won't work either.
Great product by Apple with the new great looking design.##great +1, new +1, great +1
I love the keyboard.##love +1
Probably as good as you can get in a netbook, does everything I ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses.##good +1, good +1
Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase.##satisfied +1
In my line of work, I often have to take work home, and this makes it so easy.##easy +1
They told me to reprogram the computer, and I didn't need to do that, and I lost pictures of my oldest first 2 years of her life.
I use iphoto all the time, which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike.##great +1
I bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his Christmas present.
It took so much time.
I hate it.##hate -1
The screen isn't huge, but that doesn't matter when I output media to the 50 inch LCD TV.##huge +1
I'll stick to Toshiba.
I will have to purchase Spy ware or Nortell for privacy protection.
You will not regret buying such a great thing like this!##great +1
I was said it's video card.
Plus stylish.##stylish +1
For the price and what I get out of it has exceeded my expectations.
And, if you are going to deal with HP be careful.
I took the computer into Best Buy where I purchased it and they kept it over night to study it.
If your time is worth anything to you, if you are tired of rebooting, reformatting, reinstalling, trying to find drivers, if you want a computer to work for you for a change, make the change to this computer.
My MacBook Pro is no exception.
Unless you don't care how long it takes to get going, find something else.
(You may be reading one now!
The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard.##better +1
I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro!##love +1
In fact, he said, about 10% of their products fail.##fail -1
This is the first Apple product that I have purchased.
Now, as easy as it is to use, and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop.##easy +1, great +1
This causes my wrist to scrape up against it.
Enough said.
Setting would change for some reason, the screen size would change on it's own, like the pixel sizes and whatnot.
It had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it.
Ever since I bought this laptop, so far I've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines.
I do not plan on going back.
No laptop is perfect, but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you.##perfect +1
I really like the Mac 15.4in. Notebook, but its very pricey.##like +1, pricey -1
Also, the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it.##noisy -1
iPhotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos.##excellent +1
Other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more.##great +1, well +1
We were occasional Mac users before, but most recently owned a budget PC since it is what we could afford.
Called tech support and got the usual Acer "We don't support software but for $$$ we can help you" I explained there was no software involved in booting.
I would never tell anyone to buy one either.
The programs are great, like iphoto (love the editing capabilities), imail (which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad), imovie, etc.##great +1, love +1
The only thing I didn't learn in my research was the software I would need like privacy protection and warranty protection, in case it gets broken, or crashes etc.
I can't say enough good for it!##good +1
Comfortable to use light easy to transport.##comfortable +1, easy +1
The Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks.##good +1, stinks -1
I thought the price was great for the specs.##great +1
I was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks.
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have.##down fall -1, no -1, cheap +1, portable +1, best +1, more +1
So, the hard disk capacity really doesn't matter to me.##matter -1
Just for a stupid CD.##stupid -1
Keys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet.##stick -1
It crashes, and when it goes flat, it just DIES (like a PC, maybe worse) and I loose all my open documents!##crashes -1
I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.
Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point.##simple +1, to the point +1
I am now making a point to avoid their products and I hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well.
I'v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand.
I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers.##like +1, professional +1
This just keeps having it's hard drive replaced!##replaced -1
When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP, yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost.##less -1, higher -1
" Then I proceed to tell her that I checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it wasn't LIKE THAT.
Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me.
The only downfall is the volume control.##downfall -1
Clearly, there is something wrong with the product and LG didn't take up the responsibility.##wrong -1
Very fast boot up and shut down.##fast +1
Right out of the box, this little netbook did everything I asked of it, including streaming the everyday video you're bound to encounter checking mail and websites (my biggest complaint previously).##out of the box +1
I am very happy with this laptop.##happy +1
this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with.##durable +1, easy +1
I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.##right +1
What a mistake!
If internet connectivity is important I would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more, or buy a USB wireless card.##recommend +1
I had read online that some users were having sound problems.##problems -1
My last computer, a Toshiba, cost only $400, and worked like a charm for many years.##charm +1
It discharges too quickly.##quickly -1
But to be honest, the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think I ll buy a PC next time.##issues -1
three years is a decent life, but this must make it to graduation and beyond.
I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college.
TOSHIBA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM.
Then it ceased charging at all.##ceased -1
An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will.##hateful -1
I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it, however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however, due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink.##suggest +1, large +1
*=Webcam is a bit laggy, not the greatest.##laggy -1, greatest +1
I am not much of a computer techie, so I can understand some of the internal problems, though I do have trend micro as an antiviral program.##problems -1
Stay away from HP.
The computer continued to give me issues and in Late June it completely died again and I tried to call Acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me, they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me.##died -1
I've haven't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off.##problems -1
Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside.##wonderful +1, sleek +1
It is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not.##speedy +1
I like it!##like +1
The pricing is very competitive.##competitive +1
so we got a good deal on hsn for an acer notebook and we bought it for him.##good +1
Connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all.
Its still going.
This computer is exceptionally thin for it's screen size and processing power.##thin +1
There is NO way I will buy a LG product in the future.
I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.##problem -1, quitting -1, freezing -1
Prior to this computer, I owned a PowerBook G4 for 6 years (quite a long time for a laptop).
Maybe this is virus related, maybe not, but the computer has locked up many times, and on two occasions, the screen has simply gone black.##locked up -1, black -1
The advantages of owning 'a 'mac are numerous.
I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.
Using this machine is like a mild form of torture.##torture -1
This wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought.
On the twelfth day that I had the notebook, I decided to go to Dell's website and update it.
The computer blinks it shuts off at will.
Excellent product for the money.##excellent +1
It's graphics aren't bad at all, for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum, easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics.##bad -1, easily +1, capable +1, comparable +1
I have Vista, so I am unable to install and uninstall some programs.##unable -1
The screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use, very important for use quick typers.##bright +1, vivid +1, easy +1
I can do everything I could before, only faster and more efficiently.##faster +1, efficiently +1
I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem.
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too.
i dont understand why i spent twice as much to get a laptop rather than a desktop when my lap top is completely immobile.##completely immobile -1
For those that care about noise this thing doesn't really make any;
Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.
Despite the plethora of problems, I managed to use technological trickery to keep the machine operational for two years.##problems -1
I had my IWORKS, Itunes, Email, MS Office, network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour.##perfectly +1
Simply amazing computer!!##amazing +1
I first purchased this Dell model "1764" on April 6, 201
The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance.##small +1, portable +1, tons +1
Two times with in one month.
The only downfall is a lot of the software I have won't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it.##downfall -1, worth +1
Waited on getting this computer, but it has been a great change.##great +1
For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulting when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).
Whenever tried to turn it on, it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows (or Winblows, as I like to call it).
BUT there's this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows.##allows +1
The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse!##huge pain -1
I hope to edit this in the next few hours, I am going to try to install my own copy of Windows 7.
If it's not shipped on the next business day, called on a Friday they are closed on weekends, what was the next step.

I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it, I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use.##love +1, slow -1, slower -1
I run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs I do not want to buy a mac version of, like my cad programs.
C'mon, LG.
Whenever I call Dell about an unrelated problem, they ask me if my laptop is running slowly and if I'd like to purchase more memory for $75.##slowly -1

I love this laptop, and use it everyday to do something, and never lets me down.##love +1
Finally was able to reach a young lady in California and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date.
I definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails.
The Toshiba Mini Notebook, Model NB 305-N410BL, is a great little computer.##great +1
Take your time and go through the tutorials patiently.
So if anyone is looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it...
(I'm an excellent touch typist, and my hands are very sensitive, too.
This time the mouse pad and right click key wouldn't work!
EVENTUALLY we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the MACHINE that was causing the problems.##problems -1
The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.
I bought a cordless mouse for it, but don't always take it out;
When I got it, I immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive.##heavy -1, thick -1, attractive +1
It is sleek, smooth, and lightweight.##sleek +1, smooth +1
i am a huge computer person i love any kind of computer that works well, but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing.##love +1, well +1, happy +1, amazing +1
It took Toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem.
They only stay charged a little over an hour.
Now they are believers in the product.
Had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it.
Hewlett Packard HP Pavillion DV6000 Laptop is the worst laptop we have ever bought.##worst -1
I had never owned a Mac before;
The 4 USB ports are nice, but the two on the side only work now and then.##nice +1
I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat.
i try to use it today and I can't logon.
Keyboard could use some trimming.##trimming +1
The bottom-line is that this laptop just isn't worth it.##worth +1
I returned the computer to HP and they kept it for 3 months.
Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes.##stylish +1, easy +1
Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage (keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in), buttons not working and USB ports inoperative.##damage -1, bulging -1, inoperative -1
When I am next to my router on my HP I get full service, on my Eee PC I get 3 bars.
I got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer.
Pretty disappointed about this product.##disappointed -1
The letter A stopped working after the first week.##stopped -1
By the time I was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed I had been without my computer for almost a week while I was an Online College Student, so it was very inconvenient and I had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also.##inconvenient -1
It out performs any other laptop on the market today.
This is what I call a good after sales service.##good +1
Maybe it's Acer, maybe it's MSFT.
So if you want a good machine that does almost anything this is the one, if you want a low budget computer then look at the other great brands Best Buy sells.##good +1, low +1, great +1
I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.##junk -1
I would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could.

I use this for my tutoring business, and since I'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!).##ideal +1
It is in the best condition and has a really high quality.##best +1, high +1

I went to my local Best Buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke.
Runs smooth and quick.##smooth +1, quick +1
Not a bad laptop, it's a bit slow, but gets the job done.##bad -1, slow -1
Honestly, I spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what I got on there for!
This a starter notebook.
No I am generous calling it slow.##slow -1
The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week.##downside -1
The graphics are great.##great +1
All-in-all, I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone.##recommend +1
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.##worse -1
The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc!##big +1, enjoy +1

I have had at least eight Toshiba laptops, and they have been outstanding, including this one.##outstanding +1
I called back to ensure that received it, they had.
the manufacturer's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts.
What I'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory.##well +1
If you can afford a new laptop, and are in the market for one, of course, then definitely go for this.
Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it.##broken -1
It works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box.
Now, the next issue I had freaked me out.##issue -1
i love ths notebook.##love +1
It is fast booting up , shutting down, and connection with the internet.##fast +1
The battery life is great.##great +1
This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine;##serious +1
Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if, since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it's "like new," I might have 8 months next time.
I got this laptop on Black Friday.
They replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board.##replaced -1
I fell in love with it.##love +1
It was just one problem after another for me, and that's reason we had forked out so much money was so we wouldn't have anything to worry about.##problem -1
There is nothing to complain about the system.##complain -1
and it comes with the new OSX that comes with new features that makes the use more easy.##new +1, easy +1
Maybe not the cutting edge (Satellite L455D) but it is a workhorse.
But the Macbook is the best!##best +1
Now the screen is going darker, darker, darker.##darker -1

when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.
BOUGHT FROM WAL-MART, I BELIEVE THAT THIS LAPTOP WAS A REPAIRED ITEM.
Couldnt not use it.
I sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty, so I got a new one and some other fixes they found.##faulty -1
I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one.
Great pick for portability and affordability.##great +1
It's fast, it's easy easy easy to set up, easy to hook to my wireless network.##fast +1, easy +1
I previously purchased a 13" macbook (had pro specs and was aluminum style) which had a nvidia 9800 (If I am not mistaken) and it had major heating issues.##issues -1
They didn't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement.
We used PC products - it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing.
The people there just changed for me on the spot and I got a new arm piece and they didn't even request for a receipt.
I love my Samsung TV and Galaxy S smartphone, but this Netbook was a very poor computer.##love +1, poor -1
I made a perfect decision when I bought the Toshiba!##perfect +1
I take it everywhere with me because it's so easy to carry.##easy +1
The only thing is that the battery won't last more than 1/2 an hour.##more +1
It still heats up like mad and I am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time.
The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty.##fell apart -1
I am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one.##better +1
They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer, not what I've done.
I would Highly recommend this MacBook.##recommend +1
About 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook pro, which was an upgrade from my 2010 macbook pro.
Let's just get this out of the way, I love Apple!##love +1
Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processor which works good.##good +1
The keyboard has a wonderful nature feel.##wonderful +1
They went through asking me open up various components, taking battery out, hard disk apart, and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it.
*4 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Annoyed at MacHouse Amsterdam, decided to send complaint email to Apple.
While there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down, this occurs far less frequently than on PC computers and laptops that I've used.##freeze -1
Bought with a credit card.
The battery doesn't last long but I'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem.##long +1
I was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing, I took it for granted that these features were standard.##standard +1
I did a lot of research and ended up thinking this Toshiba was the best one for me.##best +1
" I've had it now about 2 months and absolutely LOVE IT.##love +1
I have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production.
I bought this last week, and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch mouse stopped responding.##stopped -1
I am so happy to have purchased this computer.##happy +1
Oh yea, has no numeric pad on the side.
The cover for the DVD drive soon came off, too--a mark of poor construction quality.##poor -1
I returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund.
really no problems with the hand me down computers I received from my children.
I did not take the class and wish that I would have.
It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required.
But the arm velcro is torn after one use.##torn -1
Not good for a person who gets online daily.##good +1
The laptop was returned but audio issue was not fixed.##issue -1
I can't even remember how I finally got it taken care of, but I was done with Sony after that!
So it was only about 2 weeks ago.
I just love this laptop, I just wish it were all silver or they had all black.##love +1
The software is amazing.##amazing +1
We carry the netbook around here and there, hence it's kinda of irritating when the LCD just "slide" downwards.##irritating -1
There is nothing better.##better +1
I now own another Hewlett Packard.
The 2 GB of RAM is plenty, able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown.##plenty +1, able +1
The battery life is amazing, the versatility is outstanding.##amazing +1, outstanding +1
It is known as Safari, and if you are doing any website work, you should know that many hosting companies do not support it.
Vista is a nightmare.##nightmare -1
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus.
I have used a couple of others on the job as well.
The program came with the computer and works beautifully.##beautifully +1
Posted Nov 8, 2010 - Two weeks ago I bought this notebook.
Acer won't replace the laptop.
I am also upset with CR for giving a good rating.##good +1
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer, left right and front.
I have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet!##best +1
I was loving this Netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light, but after 1 week it stopped opening web pages for me (even after installing new browsers) then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime I booted it.##loving +1, amazing +1, small +1, light +1, stopped -1, crashing -1
Now I could get myself a cheap computer, that will probably work a whole lot better!##cheap +1, better +1
I would definitely not go back to using a PC after using the mac.
The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it!##slow -1, hate -1
This is the first laptop I've owned, although I used several at my previous job.
Those moments in time where you want to throw something against the wall? Yeah, I wanted to throw that laptop out the window and light it on fire.
Charger seems large for this class of computer.##large -1
I don't really have a complaint.
I'm pretty sure it's not newegg's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop.
Best Buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer.
I dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers.##dislike -1
The screen graphics and clarity, and sharpness are great.##great +1
If I have a problem with any of my apple items I make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there.
So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message.##good +1
I claim that this has no value to me, the laptop was new anyway.
Enough said.
Not working = bad##bad -1
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it.##recommend +1, worth +1
Otherwise this little notebook has met all my expectations.
My son said it popped up and he clicked update.
I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening.
The unibody design is edgy and durable.##edgy +1, durable +1
STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one-year warranty was up.##stopped -1
But, for the cost this is a winner.##winner +1
Let me tell you, this machine is great.##great +1
I have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is AWSOME!##awesome +1
Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.
The second issue I had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating, even if on for less than an hour!##issue -1
Also, the battery does not last very long at all.##long +1
Good luck with your purchase options.
Buy this if you like being tortured, teased, frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac.##frustrated -1
Very disappointed!##disappointed -1
They are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site.
I bought it from HSN because it was "bundled" with extra software, but as it turns out, that software just crashes it more often.....##crashes -1
I looked around and based off my price/features comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here.
I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.##problem -1
Strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed This device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers.##strong +1, strong +1, useful +1
Unless you need the Bluetooth 3.
I was sorely disapointed to discover that HP (what I thought was a reputable company) wouldn't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart.##sorely disapointed -1
That is pretty sad when they name them specifically.##sad -1
More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection, or the page can't be displayed.##bad -1
No viruses.
It is everything that I would want in a computer.
Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop.
However, If I sound enthusiastic about this, I am!##enthusiastic +1
You will fall in love with it in no time.##love +1
i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me.##love +1
They removed them and returned the computer to me.
I don't understand why only Windows 7 Starter is included.
On 3 July 2004, I purchased this model at Best Buy for about $150
I went with him and we picked this one.
While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at, I think there's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs.##pretty +1
This is my second MACBOOK PRO and it's better than ever.##better +1
My macbook is so much better looking and so thin!##better +1, thin +1
The notebook would not turn back on again.
The ease of use is wonderful.##ease +1, useful +1
This system came loaded with Windows 7 Starter.
-When battery life went to 4 hours or less, took it to the MacHouse Amsterdam for repair (26th of August).
The battery gets so HOT it is scary.##hot -1, scary -1
Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs.##best +1
It's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with.##nice +1, easy +1
The apple macbook pro nothing to say but professionally great and outstanding.##great +1, outstanding +1
It's also very energy efficient, running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb.##efficient +1
I am forever changed and will no longer buy a Windows based machine for personal use.
Mom, Dad, Brother, sister, You name it!
but it came back in even worse shape.##worse -1
The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys.##change -1
It is absolutely horrible to use, despite all its so called advanced features.##horrible -1, advanced +1
Before, I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from Acer's site.
I have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute.##no -1
It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.##beautiful +1, better +1
After that I turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid.##valid +1
So far, a great product.##great +1
He loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started.##loves +1, easy +1

It's the most wonderful thing in the entire world.##wonderful +1
So I'd pop them off to see what the problem was, well guess what? The darn thing wouldn't go back on.
Also, macbooks come with much more features which are so cool!##more +1, cool +1
They sent out a Sony 'Certified' technician.
They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular.##excellent +1

So far, I have no complaints.##complaints -1

Our Apple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer (Z0J80001) Notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking.
I am constantly trying to uninstall programs, clean cookies, and delete unused files.
The dv4 boasted a faster processor, more memory, and a bigger hard drive than my old computer, plus a better quality web cam, nicer screen, and many other features.##faster +1, more +1, bigger +1, better +1, nicer +1, many +1
The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in.##downfall -1
The graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid.##stellar +1, clean +1, vivid +1
Aside from the trial software and the short battery life, lack of a webcam, its great.##short -1, great +1
As a die-hard Windows enthusiast, I shunned the idea of a Mac until this point.
I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it.
if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again.
I had a MacBook Notebook, and it had absolutely no protection from viruses, spyware, malware, etc.
The computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my PC did, and I have all of the programs that were on my PC.
I made the right decision.##right +1
In the past few years, I've had terrible experiences with HP.##terrible -1
Overall, it's ok.##ok +1
Graphics are clean and sharp, internet interfaces are seamless.##clean +1, sharp +1, seamless +1
The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick, but it is still a great notebook!##newer +1, slick -1, great +1
Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recently the worst.##worst -1
I am very Happy!##happy +1
As with any laptop not purchased with software options, it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications.##useless -1
Its Office compatible, but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs.##compatible +1, new +1
I occasionally use it for work via VPN and it has not given me any problems.##problems -1
I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT.
It just works flawlessly!##flawlessly +1
Do you think I purposely "destroy" my netbook, so that I can demand a new set? Do you think it's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution? Or rather NO solution.##on-satisfactory -1
I'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $176 every 3 months just isn't worth it (that's about how long the port seems to  last).##unrepaired -1, worth +1
Ok first.##ok +1
So if you move laptop a lot, it might get loose, however it sits pretty tightly.##loose -1, tightly +1

Now I had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the Geek Squad I found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one, so back it went to get the correct drive.##replaced -1, right +1

I am taking back today.
My parents bought it for me as a graduation gift, and i'm totally (almost kind of maybe definitely) obsessed with it.##obsessed +1
The MacBook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic.##overpriced -1, simple -1, chaotic -1

It quit working within a weeks time.##quit -1
but after i got used to it i love it.##love +1
I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations (similar to Microsoft Office).
After 4 days, being denied 6 times and told off once, I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt.
Overall, I experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old PC.##fast +1
When I got the computer back and realized it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem.##out of -1

In those three years, I've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily.##problems -1, easily +1, quickly +1
Although my model was listed as recalled, HP denied my claim.
It was secure and easy to navigate.##secure +1, easy +1
I was a little weary at purchasing another 13" macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around.##in order +1
The machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your HDTV.
I am loyal to Apple.
They are by far the easiest systems to actually learn about computers with.##easiest +1
I will be patient for few months.
this apple navigates you thru the unexplored world of the internet.
This was purchased for my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised.##pleasantly surprised +1
Finally set the unit back to HP after a month of hell.
I couldn't afford a new mac, so I bought a PC instead.
The video card is great for media, and above average for gaming, but not a gamers first choice.##great +1, above average +1
It was always getting froze up.##froze up -1
my information was all lost (my fault, I know, but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac, the paragon of all computers!
But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!
I got the blue screen of death the first month I got it.
This is the third MacBook Pro in our family.
Apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience!##enjoyable +1
I had of course bought a 3 year warranty, so I sent it in to be replaced and (almost 2 months later) the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement.
Apparently there is a manufacturing defect, something with the amount of thermal paste.##defect -1
Despite the claims of the Apple apologists (a vice of which I am recently myself reformed) the internals of Mac laptops are NO different from PCs' at this point.
Took several hours with customer support before I could even start the PC out of the box.
Asus facial recognition doesn't work and windows logon isn't either.##work +1
Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service.##unusable -1
I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs, so don't go and pay for them, just ask for them and they should give them to you.##free +1
Now when I order I did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard I wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when I use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag.##easy +1
Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display.##ease +1, great +1
Otherwise, all other features are a 1
So in late March, early April 2009 I was without it again for a couple weeks while I had online courses I had to complete and my fiance was in Afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had.##best +1
The performance is awesome.##awesome +1
I pondered very long over this decision.
This thing sucks!##sucks -1
I Love my new computer!##love +1
Okay, let's just start out by saying I am in no way a computer techy.
It was a Waste of money from day one!
I'm new - just switched from years of PC frustration.
So I got another netbook which I love!##love +1
But in fact it is totally the opposite.
The display is beyond horrible.##horrible -1
He LEFT ME, instructions on what to do when this comes up, or that comes up......
It's a joke.
There is hardly any memory on the computer's hard drive.##hardly -1
Actually, I had noticed the one on the sales floor also didn't have sound!
I started having problems with it within the first month.##problems -1
Next, most Acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop.
the laptop preformed pretty well.##well +1
I'm honestly afraid that it will burn me, it's that hot!##hot -1
But I don't see it as a problem.##problem -1
Numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until I got the blue screen of death and had to send the PC back to HP.##problems -1
I think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and I need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed.
This one has had the same effect.
And if you are a game player it works with World Of Warcraft wonderfully.##wonderfully +1
This computer is absolutely AMAZING!!!##amazing +1
So buyer beware when buying Toshiba
I found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at Best Buy which was a great deal!##great +1
I got my MacBook Pro because I wanted to do all the stuff I need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes.##worrying -1, quitting -1, freezing -1
I love the Apple products.##love +1
I loved the netbook (minus the fact that it was windows OS) until this started happening.##loved +1
The minute you fire it up it's all good, very easy user interface.##good +1, easy +1
I have had two Toshiba satellite computers and while they are okay, they are in no way comparable to the Mac.##okay +1, comparable +1
I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.##expired -1
They're absolutely useless, unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall.##useless -1
was a great deal i will give that.##great +1
Theres also iDVD, a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together- photos, recordings, video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents, family, siblings, and any other person important in your life that there may be.##dedicated +1, perfect +1
His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test, and it was failing.##bad -1, failing -1
After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working (3 months of use) which was frustrating.##stopped working -1, frustrating -1
Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba?  Probably not ever again.##worth +1
I have used PC's and converting to this MacBook Pro was easy.##easy +1
I love the easy to see screen, and It works well for work, personal or just play.##love +1, easy +1, well +1
If what you need is a machine to do some surfing, email checking, word processing, and watching a movie or two, this is the machine you want.
-Apparently, contactus@euro.apple.com is not a good address to send complaints.##good +1
It doesn't have a lot of frills, but I didn't need any, and being able to buy what I needed, and not more than I needed was very important.
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i've ever seen.##worst -1
I am sorry that I purchased this laptop.
Awesome graphics!##awesome +1
It really is perfect for work and play.##perfect +1
The pro is a great product, I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge (the edges hurt my wrists).##great +1, comfortable +1
I am a college student and it has been very useful.##useful +1
The apple MacBook is the best investment that I have ever made.##best +1
My sister is the electronics manager at Wal Mart and she says that HP is the best.##best +1
One drawback I noticed was sound quality via USB.##drawback -1
The battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were SOL there to, so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased.
I needed a new computer for graduate school (had never owned a laptop before), and the only reason I didn't purchase a Mac was because my school's website strongly recommended students purchase PCs.##recommended +1
I have had another Mac, but it got slow due to an older operating system.##slow -1, older -1
If you have the money I suggest going for the i7.##suggest +1
That's very possible, but since they don't make Windows XP drivers for the sound card in this machine, I was stuck until Windows 7 came out.
I'ts nice to have the higher-end laptops, but this fits my budget and the features I need.##nice +1
It is, however, very heavy.##heavy -1
Was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued, apparently because of known motherboard problems.##disappointed -1, discontinued -1, problems -1
Well, I started using Google Chrome, which is a little better, but it freezes too sometimes.##better +1, freezes -1
Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook.##loud +1
LOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET!##love +1, wonderful +1
But, at the same time they (the company) would not and could not do anything about my problem.
Just a black screen!
All you have to do is turn it on and it works.
A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect.##contributor +1
Eventually my battery wouldn't charge, so unless I had it plugged in it wouldn't even power on.
Recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me.
Save your money and go for a better device.
I have been a PC user since middle school, but in my mid twenties I decided to convert to the dark side, or should I say the brighter side of life.
Purchased for development purposes, but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing, e-mail, etc.
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so.
My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program.##problem -1
I had a USB connect but, i can't use it because it is not compatible.##compatible +1
Accordingly, I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product (my five year old Compaq) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed.
I ordered four D620 laptops.
I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated, but once you get past the initial expense you'll find that they're worth every penny (besides, there's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers).##overpriced -1, overrated -1, worth +1
I saw this one, and I have the most difficult time trying to use them, they've made great dust collectors, I hate putting this computer down##difficult -1, great +1, hate -1
I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.##compact +1
I love the multi-touch trackpad.##love +1
I was psyched.
I absolutely love my mac!##love +1
From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer!##love +1
HP is more interested in selling extended warranties (which cost more than the netbook new) then they are in helping or fixing.##more -1
It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived.
Not too much "junk" software to remove.##junk -1
System is loosing about 20% of performance because of that.##loosing -1
It is easy to use, good quality and good price.##easy +1, good +1
The difference in the Apple keyboard from a PC's keyboard took a bit of time to get used to, but overall it's worth it!##worth +1
It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine.##pleasing +1
The extended warranty for the $4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu.
Only issue is that it is a little slow, and I'm fixing that by adding more RAM.##issue -1, slow -1
It is easily portable and I take it everywhere I go and might require internet access.##easily portable +1
If I have a few hundred dollars to spare, I'd buy the Pro line though, the 2.53 and 2.66 GHz model.
The hard drive crashed as well, and I had to buy a new power cord.##crashed -1
But enough about that, I am an Apple convert for life.
I love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky!!##love +1
But, Mac makes the switch from PC to Mac easy.##easy +1
Another issue I have with it is the battery.##issue -1
HELP, HELP, OTHER THAN THAT GETS A GREAT LITTLE WONDER.
Now I know!
After 2 months of complaints, Asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies.##right +1
Even set at the highest level, the computer sacrifices its queen every time.
That included the extra Sony Sonic Stage software, the speakers and the subwoofer I got (that WAS worth the money), the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer, the extended life battery and the Docking port.##worth +1
My MacBook Pro works like a dream, it has never overheated, or even been slightly warm for that matter.##overheated -1, warm -1
PC users use the Powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and Mac users utilize Keynote.
I can't begin to say how disappointed I am.##disappointed -1
I get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you're restricted to the width of your body for computing room.##compliments +1, perfect +1
It takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site, then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works.
Easy to carry, can be taken anywhere, can be hooked up to printers,headsets.##easy +1
also the keyboard does not light up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.##bad -1
Take the simple, easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around.##simple +1, easy +1
It is as good as new.##good +1, new +1
And it didn't show up on the reciept, I don't know how we ordered it online!
I went from BestBuy to Dell, Windows to Apple.
Back then my entire family was Devoted to the Sony name.
When I got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then I started experiencing issues again, everything from programs and drivers failing again, to it powering off for no reason, to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues.##okay +1, issues -1, failing -1, locking up -1, freezing -1
Love that it doesn't take up space like a regular computer.##love +1
*3 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Visited MacHouse Amsterdam.
They don't seem to be susceptible to viruses, which is one less big thing to worry about when it comes to computers.##susceptible -1, worry -1
I was very excited because this was my first personal computer and I was purchasing it with my OWN money I had recieved from graduation presents.
Asked the customer service rep.
So, I took it back to the apple store and they (narcissist genius bar staff) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up.##fixed +1
I cannot even imaging going back to a PC after using this wonderful computer.##wonderful +1
Basic computer.
I fell in love with the hp pavillion and that was my replacement and now I could not imagine going back to an acer at all.##love +1
It turns out that this hp pc had been previously sold by Wal Mart.
I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of garbage.##recommend +1
I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me.
I should have bought one a long time ago.
I looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key.
I got what I paid for.
Just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute, but it ran fairly smooth for a non-dedicated graphics card.##dedicated +1, smooth +1
Needs Power and Mouse Cable to Plug in back instead of side, In the way of operating a mouse in small area.
However I dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then I have EVER had with anything.
I got the first "Blue screen of death" in the early part of July.
-4 RAM slots, 2 HDD Bays*, 16GB RAM support -No Wireless Issues, at least for me.
I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.##horrible -1
In fact, somehow (and I never opened it up) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently, behind the front of the screen, in the way of the display.
It seems to be incompatible with everything else.##incompatible -1
the mouse on the pad, the left button always sticks.##sticks -1
When I took it back to Best Buy I asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane!##insane -1
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck.
I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop, and the battery life is amazing.##recommend +1, perfect +1, amazing +1
We use the built in tools often, iTunes is open nearly every day and works great with my iPhone.##great +1
But my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors.
It was returned on the third day I owned it.
IT WANT TAKE IT, IT KEEP SAYING ERROR.
Anyone who is considering buying an Acer computer of any sort, I seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand.
the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a restaurant where the food on the table is always so space consuming.##able +1
Highly recommend for daily use.##recommend +1
We are addicted to the Mac.##addicted +1
Because it IS a defective product.##defective -1
Second, it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
True quality at a great price!##true +1, great +1
Not easy to carry.##easy +1
The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics.##standard +1, enough +1
I am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review.##terrible -1
So what am I supposed to do?  The LG service center cannot provide me the "service" when it is called the "service center".
The Material this Pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any PC  Specs: Like I said this performs a lot better than any computer I've had in the past.##nicer +1, better +1
It has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it.
After doing extensive research, macconnection had the lowest price on the 15" MBP i5.##lowest +1
I am ADDICTED to photo booth!##addicted +1
The operating system and user interface is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing.##intuitive +1, large +1, amazing +1
So, I went back.
I like it so much, I bought another just for my wife.##like +1
I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one.
All in all great item highly recommend it.##great +1, recommend +1
Hard disk - The new editions gives you more hard disk space (500GB instead of 320GB) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk.##more +1
This laptop rocks (only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple doesn't support)!
It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere.##portable +1, easily +1
I don't have that additional money right now, and therefore wouldn't have purchased it at this time.
First things first, Macbook pro has many applications to make life easier, unlike the windows computers.##many +1, easier +1
And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming.##amazing +1, high +1
Fast, fast and fast, the web pages just fly by.##fast +1
I considered I may have too much on the computer, but after looking, there was plenty of space and that is not the issue.##plenty +1, issue -1
I don't use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it's perfect for me.##long +1, perfect +1
Guess I'll stay away from HP.
It is made better, thicker, and all out tough!##better +1, thicker -1
It was about six months later when the overheating problem started again, to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine!##problem -1
There is a blank lighted screen when I start and that is all.
And i would recommend this to anyone looking for a new laptop.##recommend +1
But then, something goes wrong.##wrong -1
So far so good with this laptop.##good +1
i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes.##longer +1
Avoid this model.
Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.##stops working -1
I saw walmart had the same computer for about $650 but still knowing what I know now,I would not buy it at that price.
The local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer  usually even the trouble some Toshiba satellite.
it has had some problems.##problems -1
Theres always something wrong with it, wether it be some virus you can't track down, or it overheats, sometimes even catches on fire, you just can't use it.##wrong -1
This computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life.##good +1, sucks -1
Of course, for a student, weight is always an issue.##issue -1
Now mainboard is broken, have to wait for a new one.##broken -1
The speed difference is next to NOTHING for a mac, and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $60 500gb external hard drive.##upgraded +1
2.The wireless card is low quality.##low -1
This little netbook is helping me get work done!
They also use two totally different operating systems.
They are about the same size keys.
I'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100% that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence.
I waited another month for approval and for them to "BUILD" me a new laptop.
This ain't it.
I wasn't really as concerned about portability (it's a very large laptop) but it's not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise.##hard -1, pleasant surprise +1
The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.##frustrating -1, cheaply made -1, less than satisfactory -1
They offer the best warranty in the business, and don't 3rd party it out like Toshiba.##best +1
Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden.
The only problems are the sound isn't very loud I have to wear headphones.##n't very loud -1
Again- windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with!
Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and ordered my Apple.
I should have kept my big, old HP.
everything about a mac is wonderful, it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system, but you will learn fast and its all worth it.##wonderful +1, learn fast +1, worth +1
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.##love +1
I am a wife, mom and a school teacher and a college student.
You know, using the computer should be fun, not aggravation, especially when you are playing games or working with photos.##aggrevation -1
You just get a trial version either way.
I'm all for saving money but Dell needs to step it up.
There are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a Windows computer.##worry about -1
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one.##great +1
To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.##faulty -1
I also love the small, convenient size of my laptop, making it a perfect tool for my academic studies.##love +1, small +1, convenient +1
I never have had a good result with this computer.##never have had a good result -1
I love its solid build, light weight and excellent battery life (for now).##love +1, solid +1, light +1, excellent +1
YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET FOR.
while about 8 years ago, I hope that the quality has changed.
NO more Lenovo for me.
I also bought one for my wife, and 3 for my office.
However, a NETBOOK will be a different story.
I'm glad I bought this laptop, it was worth the few ($100) extra dollars.##glad +1, worth +1
The difference is it's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now, still learning the Apple navigation, but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps.##a whole lot of fun +1, fun +1, a lot of +1, cool +1
I am a full Mac convert now.
I highly recommend that you buy this product.##highly recommend +1
Though you get a polite person, you often don't get a solution.
-I propose that I can just swap the hard drives.
It was old but it was not till we bought the Dell did we realize how great it was.##old -1, great +1
The battery holds up well, it's built very solidly, and runs fast.##holds up well +1, solidly +1, fast +1
Sound card is limited though.##limited -1
I initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13" in April, and I loved it.##loved +1
This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life.##nicely +1, lots of +1, long +1
After much battling with HP i was able to return it 4 times for repairs.
So, you can imagine how unhappy I am with this item.##unhappy -1
But let me tell you, the mac book pro is so professional.##professional +1
The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements.
go for it!
I highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college.##highly recommend +1, solid +1
The keyboard, which generally felt okay even for someone used to a desktop keyboard, now looks terrible.##okay +1, terrible -1
The display is awesome.##awesome +1
After years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses, a good friend convinced me it was time to go the Apple route.
The mouse is a little bit different than what you're used to though- it has one big flat panel and one full bar (instead of two separate ones) to click with- but you get used to it quite quickly.##different -1
It took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that I owned the warranty.
However, this laptop has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it.##fatal flaw -1
Perfect trifecta!##perfect +1
The keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard.
It was a huge monstrosity of a Laptop!
-Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly.##crashed frequently -1, decreased very quickly -1
-I propose that they can just swap the hard drives.
So don't get it.
it was a tough choice.
Every driver on the drivers/applications DVD is everything you will need for a reload.
They sent it off and within 2 weeks I had it back good as new.##good as new +1
The Awesomest of the awesomest.##awesomest +1
One, owning a mac is essentially a full production studio (in the case of a mac book a portable version).
I would like to tell you about the best laptop I just got from Mac.##best +1
I'm glad it waited, this one is great.##glad +1, great +1
I called their repair depot as was told they would send Me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot.
(For those old enough to remember, it is similar to Beta versus VHS.
It's also fairly easy to use the Operating System.##easy +1
But, I would recommend this product.##recommend +1
I know that ASUS is known for making motherboards, but this is the worst computer experience that I have ever had.##worst -1
If so, you may be having similar problems.
Some days it's just blurry, some days it appears that it's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains.##blurry -1
This is a great machine!##great +1
This is my first personal Satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous Satellite work issued laptops.##very good +1
We figure that after everything HIS pc actually ended up costing $350 more than my original Mac.
So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.##not good -1
Performance is good for the price.##good +1
The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping chosen by Toshiba.
I can see why the have soooo much money.
I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE.##frustrated -1
And Toshiba is totally unconcerned.##unconcerned -1
Summary: HP knew they were shipping out bad BIOS and did nothing proactive to resolve it.
And in 6 months, there have been no freezing up and no blue, purple, black or any other type of screen.
I had 3 months when the ports started going out.
think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop.
The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive.##relatively gradual +1, substantive +1
I'll wait and save up for a new one.
This laptop does everything I need it to very well.##well +1
They are not.
It makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze, and organizing them by place, time taken, or sending them to an online print shop, or uploading them to Flickr or Facebook etc, is not hard at all.##breeze +1, not hard at all +1
Its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop.
I bought it to use in college and it is perfect.##perfect +1
It is super easy to use.##super easy +1
Many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed.##crashed -1
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.##ease +1, love +1
I wouldn't play a first-person shooter with this, mind, but if you wanted to run MS Office, email, chat, download a video, listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store, and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in, I'd highly recommend checking this out.##highly recommend +1
The 13" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.##fits +1, free +1, best +1, great +1
It took me a while top get away from the land of PCs, but now that I have, I can't see myself going back to it.
They discovered the manufacturer's defect and sent it in for repair.
The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie!##must have +1
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!##love +1
The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV.##lacking -1
The speakers on it are useless too.##useless -1
You may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick.
This is not Best Buy's fault.
I had meant to purchase the NB205 and bought this one by accident (long story).
Most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be, half the time, the papers were then erased.
I've had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it!##love +1
Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos.
Exactly that, users.
Iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites.##great +1
I have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one.##recommended +1
they will not let you down.
Almost 4 years ago I bought what was then the current, up to date HP Pavilion--If I recall correctly, it was the dv 1300 t.
It's not a recommendation, it' a plea.
In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they "expedited" the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed, by a "Senior Tech".
Some features aren't friendly ( volume wheel, sound quality, etc.##n't friendly -1
A cheaper price should not equal a "cheap" product.##cheaper +1, cheap -1
-When I started worrying for not hearing anything from them, I tried to call.
I think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive, but I rather have a hard copy.
got another 1, and same issue.
Thank you Best Buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were GREAT too!##great +1
They were able to set-up with laptops themselves within a few minutes.
I consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need.
Adjust the sensitivity since it's not that responsive to begin with.##not that responsive -1
After a couple of years, my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery.##diminish -1, free +1
The system constantly overheats, the battery life is too short, the case is coming apart, and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly.##constantly overheats -1, too short -1, apart -1, run poorly -1
I would never buy a Dell again.
Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.
The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized.
It's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks.##easy +1
Also, I have had a lot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines.##a lot of trouble -1
The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
I am now frustrated that I still have to use my work issued Windows laptop!##frustrated -1
It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit.
iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC.##easily compatible +1
They don't crash.
As a computer science student in college, I find that the portability, longevity, and ease of use of this computer make me (shockingly) want to do homework more;##ease +1
This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update, so if you don't save your files and information, everything will be lost.
I love this little one.##love +1
So not having my laptop was discouraging.##discouraging -1
I fine Apple MC373LL/A 2.66GHz 15" Macbook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go.
Again I sent it back and they replaced the motherboard and some fan inside.
Fully charged, the MacBook Pro can last about five hours unplugged.
It was a hard decision for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing.##appealing +1
1st hand experience is very important, especially for a new customer.
I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems!##appreciate +1, zero +1
Even though it is much more expensive than many PC laptops, it is worth the price.##much more expensive -1, worth +1
I know there are way better laptops out there for the same price, and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls.
For me, keys were starting to get stuck and wouldn't type very well.##stuck -1, n't type very well -1
I don't like this company nor the toshiba brand, and I'll never  buy another one because I've put more into it then it is worth.##n't like -1
can't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers.
However, this will be my last as well.
There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when I click on it it says: " Consider replacing your battery" and it does not hold full charge.
SO? HOW CAN YOU SOLVE IT? C'mon, I just bought the netbook 2 weeks ago.
The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork.##late -1
If you're looking for a great laptop, you've found the best here.##great +1, best +1
The first program I switched on was a game for my children.
I have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop.##pleased +1
I have had my MacBook for almost 6 months and can honestly say that I will NEVER buy another computer if it is not a Mac.
I've always owned a PC and decided to try a MacBook to see what it's all about.
On two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969.
I bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her, it's very lightweight, and the response for the computing she's doing (Internet focused activity: mail, research, etc.) is excellent;##lasts all day +1, lightweight +1, excellent +1
Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer.##nice +1, happy +1, sophisticated +1
Overall, this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase!##wonderful +1, definitly worth +1
It came alot faster than I thought it would have which was really exciting.##really exciting +1
Then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.
It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed.##sleek +1, lightweight +1, quickly +1
also you may need to charge it once a day, if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac  the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it.##fast +1, easy +1, attracted +1
But if you are in the computer field you probably wouldn't be here.
The great 18 month same as cash financing and Advance Protection Plan which includes accidents like spills .
I could not handle it one hand like I can the replacement computer I purchased.
The new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing.##nothing short of amazing +1
i would never go back any more, i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone.##love +1, recommend +1
they respond: "your dissatisfaction is noted"...
I was even able to uninstall McAffe and install one of my Symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever.
( The iBook backup also uses a firewire connection).
I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased.
Also the display is exceptional!##exceptional +1
This is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old.##good +1
The computer was shipped to their repair depot  on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned.
This is basically the best laptop I have ever had or used.##best +1
(3DMARK6 score is only 8500).
I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba.
So honestly, I wasn't expecting anything less than perfection, and I wasn't disappointed.##n't disappointed +1
Learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on Windows machines.
My friends are in awe every time they come over!
little short on RAM but you get what you pay for.##short -1
It didn't come with any software installed outside of windows media, but for the price, I was very pleased with the condition and the overall product.##pleased +1
The first one I had was a 2006 model, not the Pro.
THEN, one month after the warranty expired, the replacement charger went.
2nd Mac book I have purchased from MacConnection.
I love a "pc" but I was ready for a change and tired of the windows system.##tired of -1
Your cursor will end up all over the freaking place,,,it's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words, sentences, paragraphs because of this mousepad.##freaking -1
Other installed features, such as certain printer software, are also most attractive.##most attractive +1
I normally don't participate in reviews/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts...
Most of the large bags are for a 17 inch.
I work in film editing and post production, so I need a laptop that not only has power, but memory and speed as well.
I took it home and within 30 min, it was freezing up and did the "blue screen of death".
At first when I got this product, I loved it.##loved +1
I think this computer is super lame.##super lame +1
It had a seventeen inch screen which I wanted, but I didn't realize at the time it would be such a monster!
Even doing so, the hinge may just be slightly tightened only.
company provides UPS shipping, fast, great!##fast +1, great +1
I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in.
THIS is what a laptop is supposed to be.
Then I've fixed the DC jack (inside the unit), rewired the DC jack to the OUTside of the laptop, replaced the power brick.
I purchased two laptops (for my husband and 16 year old daughter).
More relieved than anything.
It is easy to use, has great screen quality, and every so light weight.##easy +1, great +1, light +1
Great product, very easy to use and great graphics.##great +1, easy +1, great +1
Summary: Spend your money elsewhere
believe me apple has a reputation.
The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product.##simple +1, great +1
The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services.##great +1
The shop will definitely push the problem to the service center.
PC users work in Word, while Mac users work in Pages.
I am able to organize my pics, music and files easily.##easily +1
While I mostly use it for email, internet and gaming, I'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard I've come to appreciate from Mac laptops.##confident +1, high standard +1, appreciate +1
I've been having endless problems since I bought the computer - only 1 month ago##endless problems -1
The perfect notebook...##perfect +1
This laptop looks great on the surface: 17" inch screen, good  price-point, nice appearance, boots up quickly, runs fast etc.##great +1, good +1, nice +1, quickly +1, fast +1
The apple systems are over priced luxurys that aren't worth what they are being charged for, this model's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name.##n't worth -1, far from being impressive -1
My mac laptop is fabulous in both areas.##fabulous +1
pros:  the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so.##large +1
I highly recommend this product!##highly recommend +1
Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price##disappointing -1, lovely +1, reasonable +1
So far, it's an average laptop - no better, no worse than the HP I replaced.##average -1, no better -1, no worse +1
The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible.##bad -1, worst -1
Good price.##good +1
THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !##dead -1
I wanted to spend around $700 to $800 so I was directed to a nice looking HP Laptop.##nice +1
the speed is fine.##fine +1
I was starting to boil.
Hmmm - that high failure rate sure isn't reflected in the retail price.
BAck she goes!
It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer, was a six month trial.##not clear -1
not the day received.
Good for every day computing and web browsing.##good +1
While lacking some of the functions of the other versions, this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer.##lacking -1, very acceptable +1
Also, I have had a lot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly.##a lot of trouble -1, sticking -1, not type correctly -1
It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there.##lose -1
It is by far one of the greatest investments I have ever made.##one of the greatest +1
If you are a PC user looking to convert I would HIGHLY recommend it!##highly recommend +1
Excellent LED monitor and well equipped.##excellent +1, well equipped +1
This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times.
Without a doubt, the *design* of this laptop is fantastic.##fantastic +1
I couldn't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge.##long +1
I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left.
I've had my Macbook Pro since August 2009.
Unfortunately, the laptop I purchased was also a Dell and again, I have to say i hated it.##hated -1
Took a while to clean it up to my specs.
They are so realistic I am just speechless.##realistic -1, speechless -1
Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.##cheap +1, semi-decent +1
This is the first time that I tried and owning a netbook although I have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years, I find not much difference except of course for the screen size.
But the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7.##pain -1
There are differences that you need to know and take time to learn.
They have more problems then a 1980's computer.
It is amazing.##amazing +1
Needless to say, not too happy with the product.##not too happy -1
The cool thing about this is anyone can use it.##cool +1
My first laptop was an Acer that I got for Christmas.
Still, this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work.##perfect +1
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it.
The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark.##wonderful +1
I chose the iBookG4, a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone.##attractive +1, large +1, big +1
The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead.##freaking out -1
I would  say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful.
Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing, but very easy to use.##appealing +1, easy +1
I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.
The Macbooks worth every penny.##worth +1
I did not have to call the support line at all.
The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7.##outstanding +1
THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FUNCTION IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY.##unsatisfactory -1
The DVD drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well, which is annoying.##randomly pops open -1, annoying -1
Garageband is more for the musicians, and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone, good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level.##good working +1, good enough +1
I dual boot with Linux and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly.##flawlessly +1
The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space.##a lot more +1
But if you can't make your product last more than a year, you will not get my business again.
There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system can't be used with the iBook.##difficulty -1
Seems like maybe a bad shipment from Toshiba.##bad -1
Don't waste your money!
Currently if I use the laptop I can't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs.##burn -1
-Managed to send complaint email.
however, they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge.##kind enough +1, free +1
Seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the Dell
OS X is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time.##solid +1, lots of +1
I do everything on this computer - check email, facebook, shop, check blogs, write papers, listen to music, and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv.
I thought it would be a simple job.
But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers.##blown away -1
I Hate it!##hate -1
Don't buy this model.
The keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops I have had in the past.##slick +1, quiet +1, not bulky +1
I can leave my MacBook uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it won't even be dead.
Overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.##simple +1, stylish +1, fantastic +1
I do find that my MacBook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal PC especially if you enjoy technology, downloading pictures and graphic design.##a lot more bells and whistles +1, enjoy +1
First the screen goes completely out.##completely out -1
I'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages.
I love this 13" Mac white unibody.##love +1
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happening so hopefully we can get a new one very soon!
When I am at Starbucks between clients I get full bars on my HP and 1 bar on my Eee PC.
The PhotoBooth is a great program, it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera.##great +1, good +1
And inconvenient!##inconvenient -1
Many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and cannot be downloaded.##not available -1
It is so speedy.##speedy +1
Needs constant repair.
I will never purchase a HP again ever.
I had to pay for the shipping!
It blue screened on me without any warning, running simply basic Chrome.
This is another reason to like the Mac.##like +1
I took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops.
One bad thing is it gets hot.##hot -1
I'm stuck w/ a broken computer.##stuck -1
We researched and found the best price at MacConnection.##best +1
Hope this helps!
But guess what?  (you have to buy an external dvd drive it doesn't have a built in type) The notebook can't be used because it doesn't read anything for an external drive.##n't be used -1
GET THIS COMPUTER FOR PORTABILITY AND FAST PROCESSING!!!##fast +1
Apparently they're not special anymore .##not special anymore -1
I use a cooling pad but it doesn't help.##n't help -1
I'm so glad I purchased a Mac and not another PC!!!##glad +1
99 to  fix it.
Few viruses to catch;
Supplied software: The software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what Windows comes with.##greatly welcomed +1
Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby.
I'm tired of the inept service.##tired of -1
Garageband is easy to work with, like all the other apple applications I've had experience with.##easy +1
No, they don't even support their own bios and it "could be a problem with the bios" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!
While many people brag about Mac being "intuitive", it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a PC, but once I got the hang of it, I don't want to go back.##intuitive +1
Because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time, we are on the hook for the repair.
It started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in (mousing over the battery icon would read, for example, "74%, plugged in, not charging"), requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge.##randomly ceasing -1
This laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly.##brand new +1, quickly +1
If you are looking for something reliable, this is the laptop for you.##reliable +1
Info: Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing, or corrupt.##failed -1, missing -1, corrupt -1
The display on this computer is the best I've seen in a very long time, the battery life is very long and very convienent.##best +1, long +1, convenient +1
Most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on.##difficult -1
We didn't because it was already over 2,400 dollars!
But the quality, in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop.##less than the worth -1
In the first month of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced.##failed -1
Its also FUN to use!##fun +1
The graphics and screen are stunning and although I was a PC person, I was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly.##stunning +1, quickly +1
WIth the upgraded memory, the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once!##never has an issue +1
Simple to use, and great graphics.##simple +1, great +1
It still serves me well both in business and home needs.##well +1
I use my friends and family's $2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and HP, well, I'll never buy or recommend an HP to anyone!##fast +1, reliable +1
My MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made.##best +1
The internet speed is spectacular.##spectacular +1
They claim call center is still down.
Mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free.##cheap +1, free +1
If you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal.
I droped this once from the table when my baby girl grabed me one day and IT is still working with NO issues!##no issues +1
You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it.##love +1
My house is now 100% Macbook.
They're not safe, they're not durable, they just a worthless.##not safe -1, not durable -1, worthless -1
My husband uses it mostly for games, email and music.
I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem.##no luck -1
I just took the broken cords into the Apple store and they gave me new ones.
My Mac is much more efficient than a PC so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete.##much more efficient +1
It WORKS!
You just lose a customer.
I ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back, but the return calls never came.
Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth, they come loose.##loose -1
Being a PC user my whole life, it's taking a bit of time to adapt to the OS of a Mac but I'm finding my way around.
The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan.##hot -1
I have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and "fixed" the edges by rounding them off.
I hate it!##hate -1
returned it.
Downfalls: sharp edges.##sharp -1
It is a cheap throw together.
i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria.##fit +1
I would recommend Mac, and do, to anyone looking to buy a new computer.##recommend +1
The screen is gorgeous - yummy good.##gorgeous +1, yummy good +1
Did I mention everything about it, from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK?
Can't wait until I go on vacation and take it with me.
Good bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors!!!!
I had it four months when my disc drive refused to open.##refused to open -1
So, after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer, until it froze this morning--completely.##froze -1
Once again, I was told it was the suspicious  power supply  problem.##suspicious -1
It easily fits into most computer bags but doesn't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks.##easily fits +1
The Macbook starts fast, doesn't crash, has a fantastic display, is small and light (I have the 13.3" model), and isn't always complaining about updates, lost connections, errors, blue screens, etc.##fast +1, n't crash +1, fantastic +1, small +1, light +1, n't always complaining +1
It was kind of a rebellion against PC in fact, and I am certainly glad I did.##glad +1
Unable to boot up this brand new laptop.##unable -1
In addition, all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations.##easier +1
I actually had the hard drive replaced twice, the mother board once, the dvd drive twice, then they FINALLY agreed to replace it, (ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS!
I really don't like it, but I am stuck.##n't like -1
The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened, they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the "repair".
The port is secured to motherboard so when this  happens you can't see the plug at all, it's just gone.##gone -1
-Stay away from MacHouse Amsterdam.##stay away -1
Once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts.##stands alone at the top of the charts +1
I love the feel of the key board, as well as the trackpad.##love +1
Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac!##best +1
These new problems were the final straws;
luckily i had a student task force able to help, or else it would have crashed within the first year.
That seemed to solve the problem, till I wrote an article with semicolons in it.
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.##ease +1, love +1
-Touchpad will take a bit of time to get used to.
We both recently got new laptops.
I've been a PC user and I just finally switched and I am never going back.
I got the Macbook and he got a Macbook Pro.
Winters is on it's way and I imagine it will be cozy.
I bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop.
Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.
Will certainly use MacConnection again.
But, buy this model and just purchase 4GB of RAM (2x2GB for $92 or 1x4GB for $99), and save yourself $100 than the other model with 8GB of RAM.
this is one of the reasons I purchased it.
Instead of taking another chance on Toshiba, I went with an Asus G73JH-x3.
She told me flatly, "It's like that one.
If you're looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive game, you'd be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market.
It is the easiest computer I have ever used##easiest +1
So you might ask, what did Apple do for me?
Browsing, also, was no problem for me when I used itunes ( which usually slows down my PC ).##no problem +1
Should be there by the end of the week (again...).
Again, decent comp for the price, and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me.##decent +1
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.##not recommend -1, awful -1
I just got this laptop for college, and so far I am very happy with it.##happy +1
toshiba has a good reputation, my last computer was an acer.##good +1
My friend just had to replace his entire motherboard, so did my wife, and it looks like I will have to as well.
Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.##indirectly -1
Quality Display  I was surprised with the performance and quality of this HP Laptop.##surprised +1
The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.##much ahead +1
The internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily.##strong +1, easily +1
Its fast, has High definition quality in the videos.##fast +1, high +1
They transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you can't understand what they are saying.
Speakers don't get that loud, but good enough.##good enough +1
I have had it 9 months and it is already a $250 loss.
Another Great thing is the Beast graphics.##great +1
I was WRONG!
The ease of set up was terrific.##ease +1, terrific +1
Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome.##awesome +1
Screen is crystal clear, yes it's small - but it's a netbook!##crystal clear +1
So this review might be a tad bit bias.
This was around three years, maybe four years ago.
The battery life is probably an hour at best.
This is a review of windows vista system.
She said its very user friendly.##user friendly +1
Kind of annoying, but I still love the laptop.##annoying -1, love +1
cosmetically, the only thing they changed was 2 of the Function keys at the top.
I am very happy I bought this Mac, well worth the extra money.##happy +1, well worth +1
But sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the BIOS again and shut down and would not turn back on.##sadly -1, froze-up -1
There's literally no way to make it sing with Vista.
After looking at all the pros and cons, I decided on the Macbook Pro.
Screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment.##perfect +1
First, it does not have a push button to open the lid.
Hope this helped!
I used to build my own desktops from the component parts, and recently my 7 year old Pentium 4 with HT 1 GB ram SATA desktop stopped working (this was a rock star 7 years ago).##stopped working -1
I now realize that my $900 would have been better spent on a Windows laptop.##would have been better -1
Please, anyone who is considering getting this computer, stop.
This laptop serves all my needs.
) And printing from either word processor is an adventure.##adventure +1
Very satisfied.##satisfied +1
Do not  buy it!
-Estimated time to fix it: 10 working days or less.
After purchasing this thing, I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera, and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line.
I had my computer custom built from Sonystyle.com.
Another included program that is laughable is the chess game.##laughable -1
Yes, I thought the expese was a little much, but I now realize you get what you pay for.##a little much -1
It works great for general internet use, Microsoft Office apps, home bookkeeping, etc.##great +1
I will not buy another one.
Time will tell.
The price was very good, and the product is top quality.##good +1, top +1
This computer is really fast and I'm shocked as to how easy it is to get used to...##fast +1, shocked +1, easy +1
It played various games without problems and ran aero smoothly and flawlessly.##without problems +1, smoothly +1, flawlessly +1
After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working  (3 months of use) which was frustrating.##stopped working -1, frustrating -1

A tip for people looking into this computer: DO NOT BUY IT save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last.

But sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough (this could be because Im used to my Lenovo 10 tablet now) plus this is a great size if I want to unplug the external keyboard, mouse, and monitor to take it with me when I take photos and video.##more than big enough +1, great +1

It's catatonic.

I purchased a Toshiba Satellite M60 (with harman/kardon speakers!) in December of 2005.
Dismantle the whole thing? Then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before.
They should have included more memory on their computers if they knew Vista would run slowly.
Battery life could be better but overall for the price and Toshiba's reputation for laptops it's great!##could be better -1, great +1
The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
It wouldn't fit in most 17-inch bags.##n't fit -1
The first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it.
After the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace.##bad -1
I paid $800 for this computer from my school campus bookstore.

The Windows 7 Starter is, in my opinion, a great way to think about using your netbook: basics, basics, basics.##great +1
I was very worried about making the two compatible- but literally, it was so simple I was almost worried that I was doing something wrong.
Note that I don't ordinarily take the time to write a review.

I just recently had to ship my laptop back to HP for repair.

Toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it.
The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.##fast +1, flawlessly +1
Also, I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen, which is noticable to me.
Waited on getting this computer, but it has been a great change.##great +1
After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs (delivery service was slow, and without the laptop I had no access to the internet, and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again), it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years.
My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance, picture quality, and ease of use.##astonishing +1, ease +1

I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff.
At first it's like you're in that honeymoon stage with your laptop.
I didn't want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice.##nice +1

The battery life was supposed to be 6 hours, but even if I ran off the battery with the high efficiency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours.
It allows you to automatically upload photos to your Facebook account with one click.

Other Thoughts: I love newegg, I recommend them to the world however this is just unacceptable.
Now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine.
I simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti-virus.##tired of -1, bad -1, constant freezing -1
I am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little, while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it.
Right size and weight for portability.##right +1
We decided we would try to trade-in our old ones.
So far, so good!##good +1
It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.
Eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on.##blank -1

It was loaded with Windows Vista Home Premium--delivered with only 1GB of RAM, and it was a *dog*.
What a waste of time it was to run a Defrag on the PC!
The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me (I prefer it dark) or if you can crank up the brightness.##minor inconvenience -1
My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.##complaint -1
This system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix.##not worth -1
UPDATE: Two years after buying this laptop, I am now the proud owner of a lemon.
While it was highly rated, would I like it? I tried the keyboard at the store, and it seemed ok.##ok +1

I have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free, even without the warranty.##free +1
So you out of of notebook and money.
Was searching online for a power supply when I found this site.
But to be honest, I don't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming.
I would  rather spend my money on a computer that costs more than a Toshiba that  isn't good at all.
(No problem with the ordering or shipping by the way.##no problem +1
And the ram (the thing that makes it faster) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before.##faster +1
The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel.
I edit and burn to DVD a lot of video, so I obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive.##non-functioning -1

If you could stretch by a few 100 dollars I highly recommend you should replace your Windows laptop with this one.##highly recommend +1

I purchased it this year when my old HP laptop finally died and I was looking for something smaller and lighter than a laptop to carry around for classes and traveling.
I Have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same dvd in (battle of the Smithsonian) After on Hour mine was at 53% life left and his was at 69% life left.

I would not recommend the purchase of this model of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter.##not recommend -1
I've never had problems with viruses.
After they found no other way, they told me to courier it to them(since they don't allow the use of the post office) at my expense, and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn't be covered.

My husband purchased a laptop at the same time for about $300 less (he got a pc).
I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data on my hard drive.

We paid for the three year warranty and the extended warranty after that one ended as well.

I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market.
The only time I have restarted is during system updates.

The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior.##far superior +1
In due course, I'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.
It's great and we will always stick with Apple computers, we have been so happy with them.##great +1, happy +1
I should have realized that trouble was brewing .
They break down just as often as PCs do, and the only reason they don't get viruses, is because no one makes viruses for them, they're not better in any way, they are worse, try finding virus protection programs for a Mac, they don't exist.##break down -1, not better -1, worse -1
Thank you.
The benefits were immediate!
Much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me.##much faster +1

I have the A65 - right now it's a paperweight.

I'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer.##impressed +1
But when I received my replacement, I made BOTH recovery DVDs (4), and a driver/application DVD.
In addition, there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture.
The speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better.##terrible -1, cheapest -1
So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back, but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened, and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair (the price of a new one).
What's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision.##great +1
The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.

Well, I have to say since I bought my Mac, I won't ever go back to any Windows.

Sure, the initial out of pocket expense is greater, but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet, and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs, it probably comes out about even anyhow.
The best thing to do is build your own computer, but if u can't company's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $2000 systems and if you google "dell coupons" you can find codes that take a significant  amount off the price.##better +1, significant +1
There is no cd drive on the computer, which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd.
And Toshiba is a quality supplier.
For me I was lucky and a local store was selling them for $2000 off and Best Buy matched their price so I was able to buy one for under $1000
I can't honestly say I was heartbroken.
WILL NOT EVERY BUY ANOTHER LOU
Unfortunately, Apple's quality has continued to slide.##slide -1
and finally i realized that mac is the best.##best +1
It's very annoying.##annoying -1
I'm hoping that I can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross.
My only other complaint is that it gets really hot.##hot -1
I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price.##worth +1
I'm Very disappointed in Dell.##disappointed -1
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move.
I've only had mine a day but I'm already used to it...
And that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed.
The 13" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.##fits +1, free +1, best +1, great +1
I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.##5 stars +1
I also love the design, the looks, the feel, and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull.##love +1, wonderfull +1
For me, five stars is not enough.##five stars +1
I love how easy every thing is to do on my Apple products.##love +1, easy +1
Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook, I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros.
The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing;##horrible -1, confusing -1
Was not happy with one of the programs on it.##not happy -1
Also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable, easy to use computer.##good +1, reliable +1, easy +1
The first one sent: Touchpad didn't work The second sent: USB didn't work The third sent: Touchpad didn't work The fourth sent: Hasn't arrived yet.##n't work -1, n't work -1, n't work -1
I came from the Dell Laptops and now I am so glad I switched when I needed a new laptop.
This is definitely a computer worth the money;##worth +1
Only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation Apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor (such as works for windows), but iwork is cheap compared to office.##cheap +1
I am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with.
It is light and the battery last a very long time.##light +1, long +1
Better stick with another brand.
I am glad I did my research.
And at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory stick they recomended).
5 months dead again.
Also, you won't have to worry about them going online a getting a virus.
Very happy.##happy +1
The netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me.##easier +1
Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off, after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit, and the screen has a terrible glare.##falling off -1, rubbing off -1, terrible glare -1
My children won't even use it  for their school work.
THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE----BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY.##bad -1
The next time I had an issue my lightscribe wouldn't work.##n't work -1
The touchpad is extremely sensitive, which is the only drawback.##extremely sensitive -1, drawback -1
also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had##useful +1, best +1
It has everything I would need for a home computer.
The computer did what it was NOT supposed to do, and I didn't know what to do....
I love this computer.##love +1
They informed me that I had around 7 "policies" or viruses on it.
They don't translate from a Mac, even on Word, resulting in a ton of run-on sentences.
The acer one computer that I bought is 17 inch screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it, but I like the big screen on it.##hard -1, like +1, big +1
Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.
i cant believe HP put this out.
In November my computer messed up entirely and wouldn't power on after installing a Windows update, I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it, including my school assignments and irreplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things, when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history.##messed up entirely -1, unable -1
without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack, I feel like I can do programming homework anywhere.
I can have both OSX and Windows XP running at the same time!
I tell everyone that I know, friends, family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used.##worst -1
Overall : Poor, Features: Average, Performance: Poor, Battery Life: Excellent, Price Value: Poor##poor -1, average -1, poor -1, excellent +1, poor -1
Otherwise, I love it!
Having someone give you a quick tour of how to's is the best.
I have recently converted back to a mac and I couldn't be happier!
Microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows problems.##unable -1
At 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes.
They basically told me that the machine would be problem free now.
I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me.
The graphics are stunning.##stunning +1
(I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $50) Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours, or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents.##nice +1, portable +1, decent +1
after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced it The WiFi is very weak.##weak -1
You can call HP and they want you to buy more software to fix it.
It has been plagued with problems since the day i turned it on.
this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny.##more expensive -1, longer +1, worth +1
It is easy to navigate and update programs.##easy +1
The laptop is gorgeous.##gorgeous +1
It's more expensive but well worth it in the long run.##more expensive +1, well worth +1
I'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the 'old' way - and Apple does, indeed, have the better idea.
I've had hp desktop for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i don't regret buying it.
HP didn't fix it.
, Applications respond immediately (not like the tired MS applications).##respond immediately +1, tired -1
All in all, a very disappointing experience except that I learned how good the Geek Squad is and also Customer Service.##disappointing -1
Now, I guess, I'll have to unload my M6809 on some poor, hapless soul.
The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.##drawback -1, dirty -1
The laptop is very lightweight, can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight.##lightweight +1, easily +1
Seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications (ie Internet tabs, programs, etc) simultaneously.
The problems started with just the screen freezing.##freezing -1
Taking it anywhere was a pain!##pain -1
I also did not like the loud noises it made or how the bottom of the computer would get really hot.##not like -1, loud -1, hot -1
I had in the past a Dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it.
I previously owned a Toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years.
I can't imagine my life without it anymore!
defective software.##defective -1
This computer was so challenging to carry and handle.##challenging -1
Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction.##messy -1
Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.##inconvenienced -1
It is much faster than my desktop which is a Core2 Quad running at 2.83 GHz.##much faster +1
It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life.##without having to worry about +1
I baby my electronics so I know for a fact it was defective and not anything that I did to it.##defective -1
The screen is nice, side view angles are pretty good.##nice +1, good +1
The fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury - when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or don't want to bother them with bright lighting, it is very convenient to have a darker, softer lit screen.##added luxury +1, convenient +1
3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications.##crashing -1
Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely.##not to work entirely -1
Looks nice, but has a horribly cheap feel.##nice +1, horribly cheap -1
I would recommend not buying this product.##recommend not -1
its more like a snail crawl.
I have other computers that get strong signals that don't drop in places that this "net"book loses its signal.##strong +1, loses -1
The feel of this is better than the Toshiba, too.##better +1
I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality!##recommend +1, great +1
I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home, and it runs just fine.##fine +1
I am not sure if it was the drive itself, however;
So I called, AGAIN.
Also, one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp, if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells, it doesn't seem to be a problem.##sharp -1
It is easy to use, its keyboard easily accommodates large hands, and its weight is fantasic.##easy +1, easily accommodates +1, fantastic +1
Called Acer many times, they want me to pay the shipping to ship it to their repair center - I was very disappointed since it is a brand new computer!##disappointed -1
I was constantly having to roll back the computer after doing updates.
Stay away from Envy.##stay away -1
-got it back 3 months later
I have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed.
When I turned it on, nothing.
I should have checked this before I installed my applications.
The battery is really long.##long +1
Anyway, in early July of this year, the DVD burner stopped working, and the computer stared having issues with power supply.##issues -1
Had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in.##trouble -1
The 17 in Macbook Pro has been a wonderful addition.##wonderful +1
This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions.##lost -1
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in.
Comes with iMovie;
I just love my Mac!##love +1
I can not even read what I am writing half of the time.
MACS ARE AMAZING!!##amazing +1
My hp G60-244dx died after only 16 months.
They freeze all the time.##freeze -1
this one, in my opinion, might be a lemon!
The book is useless.##useless -1
COMPUTER HAS BEEN AT SERVICE FACILITY MORE THAN IN MY HANDS.
This laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases.##large -1, barely fits -1
When I called Sony the Customer Service was Great.##great +1
even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.
I sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it.
It is a much more streamlined system for adding programs, using the internet, and doing other things everyone does on a computer.##streamlined +1
My computer froze on several occasion, had buttons that randomly would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all.##froze -1, fall off -1
Not even safe mode boots.
Which was way too much money.##too much -1
To those thinking about switching, do it and do not look back!
This is an over-sized, 18-inch laptop.##over-sized -1
I had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.
The powerpoint opened seamlessly in the apple and the mac hooked up to the projector so easily it was almost scary.##seamlessly +1, easily +1
1.You can not change your desktop background (window's 7 starter does NOT support that function).
Took me 11 hours, 3 trips to different FedEx offices, and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse IT support technicians in the world.
Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.##stopped working -1
One year of trying to fix the computer by myself, with help of friends, and even help from computer experts I have given up on trying to fix it.
As usual at customer service center, she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague (I could see them).
The screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it's very noticeable.##smeary -1, dusty -1, noticeable -1
It all just makes sense.
2) Blue screen first month
I love it so much.##love +1
I got it for Christmas, and I was so excited to set it up!##excited +1
Strengths:Well shaped Weaknesses:A bad videocard!##Well +1, bad -1
You can't even get a satellite card which is why I bought to begin with.
I use it now more than I even thought I would.
The battery life, before the battery completely died of course, left much to be desired.##left much to be desired -1
Do yourself a favor, this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware...
It is a REAL touchpad, not the toy I saw in other brands.##real +1
It has worked fine.##fine +1
The most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing.##amazing +1
Long story, but after many calls to various  offices, I was told that no one can override the depot and that managers  don't take phone calls or e/mails.
I can throw anything at it (and I do), Pictures, video editing, schoolwork.
Price and purpose is awesome!##awesome +1
Wonderful zooming.##wonderful +1
The screen is huge and colorful, but no LED backlighting.##huge +1, colorful +1
the two of us use it regularly.
In all honesty, if someone is looking for a quality laptop and willing to pay a little more money for a normal sized laptop than a cheaper and less impressive laptop, then do not buy this computer.
Everything about this computer is easy to use.##easy +1
After paying over $1000 for this computer, it was not worth it.##not worth -1
Worse, for the price I could get a *netbook* that outperforms this machine.##worse -1
Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop!##happy +1
My wife recently purchased an Apple MacBook Pro and our granddaughter fell in love with it and asked for one for her birthday.
It had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted to replace my desktop machine.##most of +1, all of +1
Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.##nice +1, solid +1
I will only buy apple laptops from now on.
I would definitely suggest this laptop!
It did not have all the features I expected it to have.
Just a bunch of idiots who's English as a 5th language is forced at best.
No luck, although I waited for hours on the phone-Visited MacHouse, they stated the their call center is down due to too many phone calls (difficult to believe).
There is a backlit keyboard which is perfect for typing in the dark.##perfect +1
It has a lot of memory and a great battery life.##a lot of +1, great +1
I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter, so it's not just an isolated incident!!!
They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything.
5) Cut my losses and sold it for parts
All I can say is W-O-W.
I love this program, it is superior to windows movie maker.##love +1, superior +1
Which is what I did, check out my ACER 5517!
He has replaced his hard drive twice and (of course) has had to pay for antivirus software every year.
This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks, and I am impressed with the intuition of the design, the beauty of the product, and the excellent technological advances associated with it.##impressed +1, excellent +1
I have loved this since i took it out of the box.##loved +1
The price is great for this model, I only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room.##great +1
It seemed to be a very nice laptop except I was not able to load my Garmin GPS software or Microsoft Office 2003.##nice +1
But, like I said before, the only reason I don't currently have a Mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey.
I've also had to have the keyboard replaced at my expense.
I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a "different" computer.
Was very much worth the price i paid.##worth +1
So far, so good.##good +1
Even out of warranty!##out of -1
A tip for people looking into this computer: DO NOT BUY IT save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last.
This is a great little computer for the price.##great +1
This comes in very handy for me as an educator.##handy +1
Crisp screen, great battery life, and plenty of storage.##crisp +1, great +1, plenty +1
It's a long and tiring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.##long -1, tiring -1
All apple associates are always willing to help you out with anything, no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.##willing +1
I was waiting for this model to be released since January, and have been holding off on buying a Macbook Pro until the new model came out.
I will never buy another HP computer.
So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer##not reccomend  -1
You will regret it if you buy any dell.##regret -1
i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go.##good +1, durrable +1
Also, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use.
It started out getting hot after only a few months.
The Toshiba Satellite has been more than I expected for the price.##more than I expected +1
I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity, because it is very sensitive.##sensitive -1
I wish iWork or MS Office came with the Mac, but MS Office doesn't even come with most pc laptops.
To my mind much more usable than the toy called an IPad.
It allows me to do everything I need from a computer and more.
The best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once, it never slows down.##best +1
Keyboard is plastic and spongey feeling.##plastic and spongey feeling -1
, which Apple doesn't offer, is why I bought my MacBook at Best Buy.
previous laptops were pc's, still have them, but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system.##clean +1, smooth +1
The computer is a dream come true.
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.##love +1
I'm glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC.##glad +1
Because he said that the hinge is under the motherboard and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened.
You can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever.
I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use.##love +1, quick +1, easy +1
I took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it.
Didn't expect to repair it at once!
It is quiet and a real joy to watch work.##quiet +1, real joy +1
With notes saying they replaced the hard drive.
The laptop is relatively simple to use, though I bought  Macs for Dummies,  which is well worth $2##simple +1, well worth +1
Can't close the 2nd HDD bay since there are brackets you have to break off (even then, it still doesn't shut) That could be a major flaw for the dual HDD user.
From the start, when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine.
No tutorials on the display.
The leather carrying case, keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from Memphis warehouse.
The touch pad is among the best.##among the best +1
Very very disappointed!##disappointed -1
If you are a person like me, more on the creative side, the mac has something for you too.
I had to have these computers in my school.
Thus, when you carry it at a slanted angle, the screen will "topple" or "slide" down, if you understand what I mean.
Again.
To this day, there are NONE.
i setup my password last night with the password on my other computer.
it is an amazing image and it too is holding up quite nicely to little hands grabbing the back of my laptop.##amazing +1
first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get mac.
It's now all commodity hardware.
We also use Paralles so we can run virtual machines of Windows XP Professional, Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows Server Enterprise 2003, and Windows Server 2008 Enterprise.
I was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday.
We purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive HP needed to be repaired.
-They reported that the computer is in their headquarters.
bought notebook 07/2009.
How Toshiba handles the repair seems to vary, some folks  indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix, others had the  repair done 5 times.
I would like to use a different operating system altogether.
All of them were Windows machines.
Well, I had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my PC, but took the Apple to the conference.
The latest and mightiest Macbook pro 17-inch was bought by my university on the 30th of June 2009.
I have a business website and every time I have to change something I have to go to the public library to use a PC.
I paid about the same for my Toshiba as I did for the compaq a few years back.
This was an update from an early MacBook Pro.
I think I might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion.
Boot time is super fast, around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute.##fast +1
tech support would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $150 plus.
but in resume this computer rocks!##rocks +1
Set up was easy.##easy +1
Did not enjoy the new Windows 8 and touchscreen functions.##enjoy +1
I expected so as it's an Apple product, but I was glad to see my expectations exceeded, this is THE laptop to buy right now.
Other than not being a fan of click pads (industry standard these days) and the lousy internal speakers, it's hard for me to find things about this notebook I don't like, especially considering the $350 price tag.##lousy -1
excellent in every way.##excellent +1
No installation disk (DVD) is included.
It's fast, light, and simple to use.##fast +1, light +1, simple +1
Works well, and I am extremely happy to be back to an apple OS.##well, happy +1
This mac has been a problem since we got it.
Sure it's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100%.##light +1, slim +1
I am pleased with the fast log on, speedy WiFi connection and the long battery life (>6 hrs).##pleased +1, fast +1, speedy +1, long +1
The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key.
Made interneting (part of my business) very difficult to maintain.##difficult -1
Luckily, for all of us contemplating the decision, the Mac Mini is priced just right.##right +1
Small and still VERY powerful.##Small +1, powerful +1
I had gotten this model for  $1199.00 on my State's tax-free weekend and had a $100 off coupon for a MacBook at the local BestBuy!
Super light, super sexy and everything just works.##light +1, sexy +1
Only problem that I had was that the track pad was not very good for me, I only had a problem once or twice with it, But probably my computer was a bit defective.##good +1, defective -1
And if you are switching from a pc I highly sugest this one.
It is super fast and has outstanding graphics.##fast +1, outstanding +1
But the mountain lion is just too slow.##slow -1
Strong build though which really adds to its durability.##Strong +1
The battery life is excellent- 6-7 hours without charging.##excellent +1
I enjoy having apple products.
I've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly.##perfectly +1
I will never go back to a PC again!
And I may be the only one but I am really liking Windows 8.##liking +1
The baterry is very longer.##longer +1
And it's so quiet that I don't hear it at all.
Its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable.##ideal +1, acceptable +1
I know Apples are more expensive than PCs, but he thinks it is worth every penny.##expensive -1, worth +1
To me it's a workhorse... and quiet as can be... you even save big bucks not dishing out any extra to Uncle Sam... Definite Buy...##quiet +1
I can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied.##satisfied +1
I'm pretty sure when I bought it, my bank account went 'ouch!
Thank you so much for the great item.##great +1
This laptop has only 2 USB ports, and they are both on the same side.
It's annoying very much and I won't ever buy any Acer products.##annoying -1
This is why I purchased a BRAND NEW LAPTOP in the first place so it wouldn't have ANY problems.
It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp.##much more +1, sharp +1
As for the laptop, this is our 3rd Apple computer in the past 2 years.
Everything I wanted and everything I needed and the price was great!##great +1

It is better than my old acer laptop.##better +1
This thing is awesome, everything always works, everything is always easy to set up, everything is compatible, its literally everything I could ask for.##awesome +1, easy +1, compatible +1
I would buy it again in a heartbeat!
Keyboard responds well to presses.##responds well +1
If someone called me an Apple Fanboy it would make sense.
Lastly, Windows 8 is annoying.##annoying -1
A scratch on a $1,500 MacBook is unforgivable.
I just fell in love with this thing.##fell in love +1
Everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure.##easy +1, intuitive +1
I have no problems yet on my mac so far, and hope it stays like that.
This laptop is a great buy.##great +1
Biggest complaint is Windows 8 .##complaint -1
Only 2 usb ports ... seems kind of limited.##limited -1
It has been to early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though.
This device has met my expectations and I'm sure it will meet yours.
It has all the expected features and more +plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard.##wide +1, roomy +1
Out of all the laptops I have owned, this is by far the best!##best +1
Amazing Performance for anything I throw at it.##Amazing +1

Out of the box I noticed how small it was and was exactly what I was looking for.##small +1
The receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance.##superlatives +1
I was extremely happy with the OS itself.##happy +1
I was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it.
The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months.##great +1
Great purchase and I definitely didn't miss out on the Black Friday deals.##Great +1
The criticism has waned, and now I'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly portable computing.##recommend +1
I would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had Windows 8
MS Office 2011 for Mac is wonderful, well worth it.##wonderful +1, well worth +1
After using it for over a month, an issue started to surface.
But the performance of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment.##disappointment -1
There has been no problem with anything.
I believe with Apple - you get what you pay for.
They don't just look good; they deliver excellent performance.##good +1, excellent +1

Incredible graphics and brilliant colors.##Incredible +1, brilliant +1
I needed something affordable from Apple and was tired of dealing with PC laptop after PC laptop.
Just bit the bullet and bought the Mac hoping it will last a lot longer….
Built-in apps are purely amazing.##amazing +1
Cons: Screen resolution.
From the speed to the multi touch gestures this operating system beats Windows easily.##beats +1
I really like the size and I'm a fan of the ACERS.##like +1
This is by far the best, most reliable computer I could find.##best +1, reliable +1
I opted for the SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty ($1500-2000) which also support "accidents" like drops and spills that are NOT covered by AppleCare.
It's light and easy to transport.##light +1, easy +1
Once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed Windows 8 Set-Up you may feel frustrated.##poorly designed -1, frustrated -1
Very powerful especially for the money.##powerful +1
When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years, I decided to buy MacBook Pro.
It's been time for a new laptop, and the only debate was which size of the Mac laptops, and whether to spring for the retina display.
This was a significantly more affordable than getting a new MacBook Pro from Apple.
I have always wanted a MacBook Pro always!
The reason why I choose apple MacBook because of their design and the aluminum casing.
The aluminum body sure makes it stand out.
Overall it's an amazing product, 5 stars!##amazing +1, 5 stars +1
It is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices, and USB devices are recognized almost instantly.##easy +1, instantly +1
He's thrilled with his new laptop.##thrilled -1
Amazing product as you would expect from Apple.##Amazing +1
Nothing wrong with this computer at all!##Nothing wrong +1
And the fact that Apple is driving the 13" RMBP with the Intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered (to me.##underpowered -1
I have to wonder why Amazon is even selling this dinosaur.
Apple removed the DVD drive Firewire port (will work with adapter) and put the SDXC slot in a silly position on the back.
No hassle and no complaints.
LOVE IT I've always been an apple fan boy, but never had the money to buy a mac, only ipads and iphones, and this is my first mac, blew me away completely.##LOVE +1
The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money.##worth +1
Well designed and fast.##Well +1, fast +1
And now I am a proud MacBook owner also!
But I was completely wrong, this computer is UNBELIEVABLE amazing and easy to use.##UNBELIEVABLE +1, amazing +1, easy +1
Exactly as posted plus a great value.##great +1
The specs are pretty good too.##good +1
I am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it.
There were no scratches or dents or any marks at all.
I've only had it one day, but I really do love it and I'm happy it was economical and I'm finally able to own a Mac!##love +1, happy +1, economical +1
Since I have always used Apple products, the choice of Macbook Pro was obvious.
Apple is unmatched in product quality,aesthetics,craftmanship, and customer service.##unmatched -1
This is my first apple laptop.
It makes a great gift.##great +1
It is a great size and amazing windows 8 included!##great +1, amazing +1
I would recommend to any one looking for a first class computer!##recommend +1, first class +1
I do not like too much Windows 8.##like +1
Startup times are incredibly long: over two minutes.##long -1
I bought this Macbook Pro from Best Buy under a year ago to replace my old Macbook Air.
The macbook pro is really responsive.##responsive +1
Also stunning colors and speedy##stunning +1, speedy +1
it is really expensive though.##expensive -1
great price free shipping what else can i ask for!!##great +1, free +1
This mouse is terrific.##terrific +1
I will also say it is much better than I expected!##better +1
This computer does everything i need it to do for school and more.
It is really thick around the battery.##thick -1
And windows 7 works like a charm.##charm +1
And I can attach my projector to it.
:) Great product, great price, great delivery, and great service.##Great +1, great +1, great +1, great +1
:] It arrived so fast and customer service was great.##fast +1, great +1
tried windows 8 and hated it !!!##hated -1
The price is higher than most lab top out there; however, he/she will get what they paid for, which is a great computer.##higher -1, great +1
So, I thought why not give Mac Book pro a try.
Set up was a breeze.##breeze +1
But I do NOT like Win8.##like +1
I have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and computers - but this is by far the most superior machine I have ever owned.##superior +1
I am still in the process of learning about its features.
BTW, I checked online regarding the old laptop that 'died' and found that I was not alone, far from it.
I had the same reasons as most PC users: the price, the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games.##overbearing -1, lack -1
I wanted it for it's mobility and man, this little bad boy is very nice.##nice +1
Seems to me that's the best way to get Apple's attention.
Very nice so far.##nice +1
You won't be disappointed.##disappointed -1
The investment of a new MacBook Pro came at a price, but totally worth it for a good piece of mind.##worth +1, good +1
I found the mini to be:Exceptionally easy to set up##easy +1
Having USB3 is why I bought this Mini.
Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it.
The sound is nice and loud; I don't have any problems with hearing anything.##nice +1, loud +1
It is very slim, the track pad is very much impressed with me.##slim +1, impressed +1
This was the same problem with my MacBook (circa 2007) that I just retired.
Great things come in small "packages.##Great +1
HUGE Apple MAC Fan!
Looked at HP, ASUS, Acer, Sony and a bunch of other ones but could not find I really liked.
The settings are not user-friendly either.##user-friendly +1
Honestly, I am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs.
Most of them were either too big, too noisy and too slow after 2 years.##big -1, noisy -1, slow -1
The machine is used, but is like new, i'm very impress.##impress +1
Thank goodness for OpenOffice!
Awesome form factor, great battery life, wonderful UX.##Awesome +1, great +1, wonderful +1
Needless to say, the leap from that to this has been amazing and (aside from the financial reasons) I am astounded that I hadn't made the switch sooner.##amazing +1, astounded +1
Its perfect, not much heavy.##perfect +1, heavy -1
i love the keyboard and the screen.##love +1
I find it not to be very user friendly.##user friendly +1
It has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs.
However, there are MAJOR issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless.##issues -1, useless -1
What angers me more than anything else is that I spent all those years hating MACs when I could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief!
I've already upgraded o Mavericks and I am impressed with everything about this computer.##impressed +1
So this is very good computer and i highly suggest it.##good +1
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been.
I was going to buy today and noticed it went back up to $344.99?
Not as fast as I would have expect for an i5.##fast +1
SO of course this one came through with the awesomeness!
You will not regret buying this computer!
Nothing bad to say about it.##Nothing bad +1
It s heavy for Mac book but is good.##heavy -1, good +1
thanks for great service and shipping!##great +1
Deal of the year.
My sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason.
Minis make sense for a lot of people.
The performance seems quite good, and built-in applications like iPhoto work great with my phone and camera.##good +1, great +1
This Mac Mini makes the Macbook Pro seem slow.##slow -1
I did swap out the hard drive for a Samsung 830 SSD which I highly recommend.##recommend +1
I bought this MacBook Pro to replace my six-year-old PC (a Sony Vaio), but it was basically no better than my old PC, so I returned it.
I wanted a simple, reliable  laptop.##simple +1, reliable +1
Cheaper than buying it @ apple too!##Cheaper +1
I have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer.
Extremely disappointed with the way it is.##disappointed -1
Never been happier using  computer.
I have had a total of 5 different laptop from many different manufactures.
Does everything I wanted this laptop to do.
Besides, the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales.##lack -1
Turns out this is a common problem.
Starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go.
It is also fast as can be... you get what you pay for... well worth the investment##fast +1, well worth +1
But I'm still learning so can't rate it yet for everything.
Overall very impressed, Thank you Apple and Amazon!##impressed +1
Yes, that's a good thing, but it's made from aluminum that scratches easily.##good +1, scratches easily -1
Very fast for my needs.##fast +1
I bought this Mac in order to replace my old Dell laptop.
Quick and has built in virus control.##Quick +1
Took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without.
I saw the Mini Mac at Best Buy and decided to get this as my replacement.
I finally decided on this one and couldn't be any happier.
I was also informed that the components of the Mac Book were dirty.##dirty -1
So glad I did not waste money on a less than par product.
Haven't regretted it one bit.
The one thing that Apple does right is computers.
the hardware problems have been so bad, i can't wait till it completely dies in 3 years, TOPS!##bad -1
It's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion!##nice +1, long +1
I think that they are the best out on the market.##best +1
HOWEVER I chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive.
That's quite a bump up from the $599 that this little guy sells for, which leaves me to my next point.
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands.##smooth +1, heavy -1
My laptop is so light that I can take it with me anywhere.##light +1
it's exactly what i wanted, and it has all the new features and whatnot.
You can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish.##fast +1, stylish +1
Finally decided to try a MAC because there were too many choices of which PC's to buy and EVERYONE who had a MAC said "buy a MAC".
Can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a MacBook?
It feels cheap, the keyboard is not very sensitive.##cheap -1, sensitive +1
That defeated the whole point of a laptop.
Though please note that sometimes it crashes, and the sound quality isnt superb.##crashes -1, superb +1
It is very easy to navigate even for a novice.##easy +1
But until now, no complains at all.
The cons are more annoyances that can be lived with.
Does everything I need it to, has a wonderful battery life and I couldn't be happier.##wonderful +1
Great Performance and Quality.##Great +1
Just What I Needed For Portable And My Wallet Too!
The device speaks about it self.
I used windows XP, windows Vista, and Windows 7 extensively.
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously RIGHT after i bought this one.
it does get hot when using on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a desk ... this is in an un-air conditioned room in air condition it gets slightly warm......##hot -1
I did add a SSD drive and memory
I got this one for thanks giving Offer for $962 :).
I had my PC laptop for 3 years and going to a MacBook Pro is like I leaped through time.
On start up it asks endless questions just so itunes can sell you more of their products.
Pretty much made sense to get a Mini.
I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new OS.
not something you want to miss out on!!!
One more thing, this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC's, also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables.
I bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design.
I previously owned an older Dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years.
Its a pretty decent computer.##decent +1
I never tried any external mics with that iMac.
The new os is great on my macbook pro!##great +1
It was fast, and it was "different".##fast +1, different +1
I had a little problem adjusting to the small screen but works fine as long as I remember to carry my glasses.##problem -1, small -1
I purchased my first Mac and am glad I did.##glad +1
I have experienced no problems, works as anticipated.
System is running great.##great +1
Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks.##Easy +1
They really screwed the pooch on this one.
The MAC Mini, wireless keyboard / mouse and a HDMI cable is all I need to get some real work done.
I finally pulled the trigger and I am blown away by how much more I enjoy my computer tasks using the Mac Mini!!!##enjoy +1
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good, working well so far.##good +1, well +1
I work as a designer and coder and I needed a new buddy to work with, not gaming.
I was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure.
The new operating system makes this computer into a super iPad.##super +1
I am very happy with my first Mac.##happy +1
Easy to set up and go!##Easy +1
I can't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up.##quiet +1, quick +1
The only issue came when I tried scanning to the mac.
The machine is speedy and efficient.##speedy +1, efficient +1
I think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point.##good +1
A *big* upgrade from my 13" 2006 macbook.
It's just what we were looking for and it works great.##great +1
Having a Mac certainly makes life easier.##easier +1
It's so quick and responsive that it makes working/surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable!##quick +1, responsive +1, pleasurable +1
The old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while.
It works fine, and all the software seems to run pretty well.##fine +1, well +1
For this purpose, it's great.##great +1
Couldn't have asked for more!
I'm using this computer for word processing, web browsing, some gaming, and I'm learning programming.
It certainly does, but you rarely hear any of your friends with Mac's complain about anything.
My wife was so excited to open the box, but quickly came to see that it did not function as it should.
I don't have any technical pearls to share.
I wanted a computer that was quite, fast, and that had overall great performance.##fast +1, great +1
Apple "Help" is a mixed bag.
All I can say is I am impressed.##impressed +1
It suddenly can not work.
It did everything we expected!
Harddrive was in poor condition, had to replace it.##poor -1
The on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner.##obscure -1
It's a nice little gadget.##nice +1
My only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini.##lack -1
The only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming, otherwise the integrated Intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks.##good +1, well +1
It's macbook pro and there is no discussion about it.
I'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple.
I use it mostly for content creation (Audio, video, photo editing) and its reliable.##reliable +1
It is the best all around Mac.##best +1
Screen is bright and gorgeous.##bright +1, gorgeous +1
Also is portable and reliable.##portable +1, reliable +1
The only solution is to turn the brightness down, etc.
It is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but I am very satisfied.##satisfied +1
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications.
It is robust, with a friendly use as all Apple products.##robust +1, friendly +1
Even if you don't do business, thats okay, it's incredibly fast.##fast +1
It is fast and easy to use.##fast +1, easy +1
This was absolutely annoying!##annoying -1
And the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up##speeds things up +1
But for those of you that dont have a mac and are still on the PC's this is a good foot in the door into mac.##good +1
I have been PC for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help##intuitive +1, great +1
and it fits in my briefcase with ease##ease +1
Nice screen, keyboard works great!##Nice +1, great +1
Still not bad for 220.00.
I was amazed at how fast the delivery was.##amazed +1, fast +1
Good computer and fast.##Good +1, fast +1
I've installed to it additional SSD and 16Gb RAM.
The memory was gone and it was not able to be used.##gone -1
Its pretty much fire it up and go.
It works great and I am so happy I bought it.##great +1, happy +1
Let me start off by saying that I was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop.##reluctant -1
I like the design and ease of use with the keyboard, plenty of ports.##like +1, ease +1, plenty +1
Apple is living up to its name with the mini and, for our needs, it's perfect.##perfect +1
it definitely beats my old mac and the service was great.##great +1
I went from a Macbook to this Mac Mini and this was a great upgrade!##great +1
Web browsing is very quick with Safari browser.##quick +1
It couldn't have been a better decision.
I like the lighted screen at night.##like +1
It's great to have a solid Mac in the living room.##great +1, solid +1
It is really easy to use and it is quick to start up.##easy +1, quick +1
I've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts.##slow -1
Very light and easily maneuverable.##light +1, easily maneuverable +1
USB3 Peripherals are noticably less expensive than the ThunderBolt ones.##less expensive +1
This can be annoying at first but you just have to train yourself not to to start over so far.
And mine had broke but I sent it in under warranty - no problems.
I am not happy with my purchase
It's fast, light, and is perfect for media editing, which is mostly why I bought it in the first place.##fast +1, light +1, perfect +1
However, the machine itself left a bit to be desired.
The battery lasts as advertised (give or take 15-20 minutes), and the entire user experience is very elegant.##elegant +1
I spent months looking for a good laptop for me and I finally found it!##good +1
$999.00 Tax free.
Thanks for the fast shipment and great price.##fast +1, great +1
!Excellent performance, usability, presentation and time response.##Excellent +1
The smaller size was a bonus because of space restrictions.##smaller +1
I blame the Mac OS.##blame -1
But for now, this laptop is still a workhorse.
In fact I still use many Legacy programs (Appleworks, FileMaker Pro, Quicken, Photoshop etc)!
It's small but powerful, light but strong, elegant and beautiful... In resume: it's a Mac!##small +1, powerful +1, light +1, strong +1, elegant +1, beautiful +1
I like the operating system.##like +1
I wish I would have taken the plunge years ago.
I love the form factor.##love +1
I haven't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review.
It's fast at loading the internet.##fast +1
So much faster and sleeker looking.##faster +1, sleeker +1
I plan on using my MacBook Pro for a long time.
Unfortunately, it runs XP and Microsoft is dropping support next April.
Its seen in movies, sitcoms, prominent important people carry and use them and they are GREAT!##GREAT +1
First off, I really do like my MBP... once used to the OS it is pretty easy to get around, and the overall build is great... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on.##like +1, easy +1, great +1, best +1
Does exactly what I bought it 4.
Buy the Mac Mini it's a terribly great machine.##great +1
It is made of such solid construction and since I have never had a Mac using my iPhone helped me get used to the system a bit.##solid +1
I love this piece of equipment, It will be hard to go back to other type of laptop after using a MacBook Pro.##love +1
Very nice unibody construction.##nice +1
Very disappointed with Apple.##disappointed -1
This Macbook Pro is fast, powerful, and runs super quiet and cool.##fast +1, powerful +1, quiet +1, cool +1
***The review below is no longer relevant, Apple has fixed the issue.
It's ok but doesn't have a disk drive which I didn't know until after I bought it.##ok +1
There is no HDMI receptacle, nor is there an SD card slot located anywhere on the device.
It really is very light compared to other computers.##light +1
It came in brand new and works perfectly.##perfectly +1
This machine is Amazing.##Amazing +1
It shouldn't happen like that, I don't have any design app open or anything.
MY TRACKPAD IS NOT WORKING.##NOT WORKING -1
I just hope this expensive laptop doesn't go dead like my friends ... it did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust.
Considering another computer should be out of the question
It looks and feels solid, with a flawless finish.##solid +1, flawless +1
Its worth every Penny.##worth +1
Price was higher when purchased on MAC when compared to price showing on PC when I bought this product.##higher -1
This was a great deal for a decked out MacBook Pro.##great +1
Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off.
Get this instead, you won't be sorry.
The configuration is perfect for my needs.##perfect +1
and the speakers is the worst ever.##worst -1
I think it was around 16 hundred bucks last I checked.
Its the best, its got the looks, super easy to use and love all you can do with the trackpad!..##best +1, easy +1, love +1
It's fast, quiet, incredibly small and affordable compared to other Mac models.##fast +1, quiet +1, small +1, affordable +1
Web surfing is smooth and seamless.##smooth +1, seamless +1
It was so exciting for me to unwrap my new mac.
I'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product.##pleased +1
so when I had the money to buy one I bought other things instead ... a 700 laptop and some extra stuff with it.
This item is a beautiful piece, it works well, it is easy to carry and handle.##beautiful +1, well +1, easy +1
See retired recently and decided that she wanted a laptop.
It was also suffering from hardware (keyboard) issues, relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime.##issues -1, slow -1, shortening -1
I'm no regular customer I hate wasting my time with hellos and how can I help you's.
Runs good and does the job, can't complain about that!##good +1
It's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk.##silent +1, small +1
I have nothing to regret from this new product.##nothing to regret +1
The exterior is absolutely gorgeous.##gorgeous +1
Have one myself and Love it!##Love +1
It has a very high performance, just for what I needed for.##high +1
This is especially disheartening when Apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals.##disheartening -1
Apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset.##defective -1
Stop living in the stone age and buy a mac, you will not be sorry at all!!
OSX Mountain Lion  soon to upgrade to Mavericks.
Apple hit a home run here.
I just bought the new MacBook Pro, the 13" model, and I can't believe Apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to USB ports.
So glad I have gone this route!!
It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid.
It is the perfect size and speed for me.##perfect +1
I am so addict to this laptop.##addict +1
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIFIC!!##TERRIFIC +1
Trashed it when I spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe.
My last laptop was a 17" ASUS gaming machine, which performed admirably, but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life, I found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome, not to mention that the ASUS had been slowly developing problems ever since I bought it about 4 years ago.##admirably +1, problems -1
However, it did not have any scratches, ZERO battery cycle count (pretty surprised), and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly.##surprised +1, ZERO +1, perfectly +1
After fumbling around with the OS I started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue.
I couldn't be more pleased.##pleased +1
And as for all the fancy finger swipes -- I just gave up and attached a mouse.
I needed a laptop with big storage, a nice screen and fast so I can photoshop without any problem.##big +1, nice +1, fast +1
I like coming back to Mac OS but this laptop is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $400  old HP laptop.##lacking -1
It is much better than the Acer ultrabook I had before.##better +1
Shipped very quickly and safely.##quickly +1, safely +1
I finally own a piece of computing equipment that I don't want to take a baseball bat and destroy.
The thunderbolt port is awesome!##awesome +1
User friendly, fast and high tech  It is amazing!##User friendly +1, fast +1, high tech +1, amazing +1
The performance is definitely superior to any computer I've ever put my hands on.##superior +1
It's great for streaming video and other entertainment uses.##great +1
Apple did a great job.##great +1
I like the design and its features but there are somethings I think needs to be improved.##like +1
There were small problems with Mac office.
It is extremely fast and very compact.##fast +1, compact +1
I understand I should call Apple Tech Support about any variables(which is my purpose of writing this con) as variables could be a bigger future problem.
I ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with spec of the new 27" Imacs.##disappointed -1
It still works and it's extremely user friendly, so I would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things##user friendly +1, recommend +1, efficient +1
Its fast, easy to use and it looks great.##fast +1, easy +1, great +1
(but Office can be purchased) IF I ever need a laptop again I am for sure purchasing another Toshiba!!
I haven't tried the one with retina display... Maybe in the future.
You can read all about the details of this marvelous computer on wikipedia.##marvelous +1
Performance is much much better on the Pro, especially if you install an SSD on it.##better +1
Note, however, that any existing MagSafe accessories you have will not work with the MagSafe 2 connection.
If you get a lemon (I have two thirds of my  Macs), you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it, even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers.
The only thing I dislike is the touchpad, alot of the times its unresponsive and does things I dont want it too, I would recommend using a mouse with it.##dislike -1, unresponsive -1, recommend +1
Yeah, it's super expensive.##expensive -1
The Mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and runs very quiet, actually the fans aren't audible unlike my old pc##smaller +1, quiet +1, audible -1
MAYBE The Mac OS improvement were not The product they Want to offer.
It came before the day it supposed to which is great.##great +1
I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new Mac ecosystem.
It's absolutely wonderful and worth the price!##wonderful +1, worth +1
It's a good fix, in my opinion.##good +1
I am please with the products ease of use; out of the box ready; appearance and functionality.##ease +1, out of the box +1
Buying a Mac Mini would allow me to make the transition.
Before I begin, I will say that I am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - I am not an Apple fanboy.
its by far faster and more stable then my PC.##faster +1, more stable +1
I purchased a MacBook Pro and this to replace a couple of HP units that I was using.
you will not regret it, promise you!
Moving from a PC to Mac has never been easier, and I'm glad that I did it.##glad +1
Perfect for all my graphic design classes I'm taking this year in college :-)##Perfect +1
Have used only Macs for years.
Being a tech savvy, APPLE - product loving person, I'm glad I finally got the MacBook Pro!##glad +1
I was always against them but now I buying one I'll never go back to PC.
I will not be using that slot again.
I think that was a great decision to buy##great +1
The OS is fast and fluid, everything is organized and it's just beautiful.##fast +1, fluid +1, organized +1, beautiful +1
It will make life so much easier next semester, just wish I had it last semester!!##easier +1
I paid for a new laptop, but was sent a used one.
Searched it on amazon and on bestbuy.
I bought this one for my 11 year old and the MacBook Air for my 9 year old.
I bought it for college and so far it's amazing!##amazing +1
They are simpler to use.##simpler +1
It was at my door in less than 24 hours.
It's also very pricey but you just have to tell yourself it's an investment and that it's gonna last you a long time.##pricey -1
It was getting old and I needed a new school computer.
!so nice .. stable .. fast .. now i got my SSD !##nice +1, stable +1, fast +1
I love apple but unlike others That does not prevent me to not be honest about how i like it and if its good or not.##love +1
So, I'm cooled on Mac buys.
It is a great computer for that and I have to say I'm happy I switched.##great +1, happy +1
Also, in using the built-in camera, my voice recording for my vlog sounds like the interplanetary transmissions in the "Star Wars" saga.
Overall a nice computer.##nice +1
You can imagine that an expensive item as a laptop will not be left on your front steps, it needs signature to pove that you received it.
I love the quick start up.##love +1
Yes, he is a self professed "Mac snob.
You just cannot beat the functionality of an Apple device.##cannot beat +1
Yet my mac continues to function properly.##properly +1
Graphics are much improved.##improved +1
Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase:Build Quality - Seriously, you can't beat a unibody construction.##confident +1
It's the mid 2012 version.
It provides much more flexibility for connectivity.##more +1
I want the portability of a tablet, without the limitations of a tablet and that's where this laptop comes into play.
I have had many, many issues with PC's in the past and I'm finally glad to have joined the Mac revolution!##glad +1
Mac tutorials do help.##help +1
When it broke I wanted another Acer and chose the V5.
The technical support was not helpful as well.##helpful +1
I got the new adapter and there was no change.
so i called technical support.
Nothing about it that i don't love, apple always makes a great product.##love +1, great +1
I saved about $100 plus tax ordering on Amazon and since I have prime, it arrived overnight for just $3.99 more.
Came with iPhoto and garage band already loaded.
It's all a bit magical.##magical +1
Logic board utterly fried, cried, and laid down and died.##utterly fried -1
It is BLAZING fast!##fast +1
The sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results.##crappy -1
ive never had a problem with it!
I currently own a Lenovo laptop as well as my new MacBook Pro, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses.
OSX Lion is a great performer..extremely fast and reliable.##great +1, fast +1, reliable +1
Best commuter I have ever owned.##Best +1
What can I say, It's an Apple.
Having heard from friends and family about how reliable a Mac product is, I never expected to have an application crash within the first month, but I did.##crash -1
The Macbook pro's physical form is wonderful.##wonderful +1
I have an iPhone, and iPad, so it just made sense to finish off the platform by adding the Mini.
Not super light but still a good one.##light +1, good +1
The Mini's body hasn't changed since late 2010- and for a good reason.##good +1
The unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than Apple's previous laptops.##solid +1
i had to return it for a replacement.
It was wonderful deal for the wonderful product.##wonderful +1, wonderful +1
It completely supports my home business and personal life.
3D rendering slows it down considerably.##slows it down -1
Got this Mac Mini with OS X Mountain Lion for my wife.
I am pleased to report that it is one of the best presents I have received to date.##pleased +1, best +1
Every day I had this computer, something failed on it.##failed -1
fast, great screen, beautiful apps for a laptop;priced at 1100 on the apple website;amazon had it for 1098+ tax -  plus i had a 10% off coupon from amazon-cost me 998 plus tax- 1070- OTD!##fast +1, great +1, beautiful +1
12.44 seconds to boot.
All the ports are much needed since this is my main computer.
The Like New condition of the iMac MC309LL/A on Amazon is at $900+ level only, and it is a Quad-Core 2.5 GHz CPU (similar to the $799 Mini), with Radeon HD 6750M 512MB graphic card (this mini is integrated Intel 4000 card), and it even comes with wireless Apple Keyboard and Mouse, all put together in neat and nice package.##neat +1, nice +1
Put a cover on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint.##complaint -1
Within a few hours I was using the gestures unconsciously.
This mac does come with an extender cable and I'm using mine right now hoping the cable will stay nice for the many years I plan on using this mac.
This is the third in a series of MacBooks starting with a Black MacBook.
The 2.9ghz dual-core i7 chip really out does itself.
My life has been enriched since I have been using Apple products.##enriched +1
i FINALLY DID IT AND THIS MACHINE IS THE WAY TO GO!
It is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me.##snappy +1, good +1
The few things that are wrong with it are very minor things.
So noise is reduced at least 50% and the heat is much better, now it doesn't feel hot but warm.##reduced +1, better +1
Not sure on Windows 8.
It's a lottery at this point as I have read that other have received new ones with the same problem.
My one complaint is that there was no internal CD drive.##complaint -1
This newer netbook has no hard drive or network lights.
This is the first time for me to use a Mac and I'm really happy with the move.##happy +1
No complaints for an Apple product.
The new MacBook is light-years ahead of my old white plastic MacBook circa 2006.
I would say that 85% of the design industry is Mac for good reason.
I was having a though time deciding between the 13" MacBook Air or the MacBook Pro 13" (Both baseline models, priced at 1,200 $ retail)
The last new mac I bought was in 1998.
There are reviews that speak to a few possible glitches but, I haven't seen them yet.
Not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports.##expense -1, enough +1
I am very satisfied with the mini.##satisfied +1
The audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity.##low -1, unusable -1
I am going to college next year and I needed a cheaper, quality computer for the goals I am trying to pursue.
In the short time of one month since the 2012 Mac Mini was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising.
It is lightweight and the perfect size to carry to class.##lightweight +1, perfect +1
If you have to ask you don't own a Mac and your just not in the know.
All my devises “talk” to each other.
Why not 5 stars?
Very Very Highly Recommended.##Recommended +1
?I am only interested in the 15.4  McBook Pro  Model # MD103LL/A
I don't know why I didn't make the switch sooner ... o ya because it's expensive.##expensive -1
I was given a demonstration of Windows 8.
The Macbook Pro is the premier choice for college students.##premier +1
Their products, including the MBP, are beautiful, sleek and clever.##beautiful +1, sleek +1, clever +1
The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities.##beautiful +1, wonderful +1
I thought that it will be fine, if i do some settings.
Runs very smoothly.##smoothly +1
Perfect--thanks so.##Perfect +1
Also, it hardly ever crashes.##hardly ever crashes +1
I was so excited to get this in the mail i nearly gave myself a heart attack.
Boot-up slowed significantly after all Windows updates were installed.##slowed significantly -1
More likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution.
When i finally held it in my hands i kissed it, yes i did.
It was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet, word processing, graphic design and gaming.##powerful +1
This computer is not cheap and represent an achievement for me.
I like the Mini Mac it was easy to setup and install, but I am learning as I go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features I was use to on the PC especially the right mouse click menu.##easy +1
GET THIS MACHINE
It's shiny and it's pretty.##shiny +1, pretty +1
Runs real quick.##quick +1
All the above aside this machine ROCKS!##ROCKS +1
Buy the separate RAM memory and you will have a rocket!
Since the machine's slim profile is critical to me, that was a problem.##slim +1
Bottom line, if you can afford it, get a Mac!
I finally made the leap after my Gateway crapped out on me.
WiFi capability, disk drive and multiple USB ports to connect scale and printers was all that was required.
The SD card reader is slightly recessed and upside down (the nail slot on the card cannot be accessed), if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue, but its not.##recessed -1, upside down -1
Soft touch, anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws.##Soft +1
Simple details, crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden, bulky sticker filled laptops.##Simple +1, crafted +1
First of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum .##nice +1
Who makes a laptop that can't rest on your lap?
After all was said and done, I essentially used that $450 savings to buy 16GB of RAM, TWO Seagate Momentus XT hybrid drives and an OWC upgrade kit to install the second hard drive.
The Dell Inspiron is fast and has a number pad on the keyboard, which I miss on my Apple laptops.##fast +1
wow the new macbook pro hanged as i tried to type this review.
The MacBook Pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer.##great +1
I was concerned that the downgrade to the regular hard drive would make it unacceptably slow but I need not have worried - this machine is the fastest I have ever owned...##fastest +1
This one still has the CD slot.
No HDMI port.
I had to install Mountain Lion and it took a good two hours.##good +1
Customization on mac is impossible.##impossible -1
I hope this review helps.
However, you have to adjust yourself to what it will do, not what you want it to do.
I am replacing the HD with a Micron SSD soon.
Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive.##intuitive +1
Far superior to my MacBook.##superior +1
The SuperDrive is quiet.##quiet +1
It was quite easy.##easy +1
The power plug has to be connected to the power adaptor to charge the battery but won't stay connected.
I decided to buy a few notebooks for my nephews for Xmas.
The battery was completely dead, in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside.##dead -1
This is no exception.
if yo like practicality this is the laptop for you.##like +1
The OS is great.##great +1
I have had a black macbook since 2007.
I tried several monitors and several HDMI cables and this was the case each time.
CONS: Price is a bit ridiculous, kinda heavy.##ridiculous -1, heavy -1
If that is the case, then I am completely happy##happy +1
10/10 five stars would recommend.##five stars +1, recommend +1
The troubleshooting said it was the AC adaptor so we ordered a new one.
I fell in love with my machine, and it was pampered.##fell in love +1
Fan only comes on when you are playing a game.
Which it did not have, only 3 USB 2 ports.
No startup disk was not included but that may be my fault.
There is no "tools" menu.
It is very fast and has everything that I need except for a word program.##fast +1
Needs a CD/DVD drive and a bigger power switch.
It is the best laptop ever!!!##best +1
My laptop with Windows 7 crashed and I did not want Windows 8.##crashed -1
Was skeptical about buying an electronic item online but it turned out to be a positive experience.
Not a scratch or mark on it.
Easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for ADSl cable or wifi.##Easy +1, small +1, easy +1
Words cannot express how much I love my new Mac.##love +1
The speakers could have been better but it wasn't a deal breaker... this is a great little laptop... love it!##better +1, great +1, love +1
The item received was exactly as identified.
Its everything mac offers.
Nice packing.##Nice +1
Besides being elegant, the MacBooks are durable.##elegant +1, durable +1
I switched to this because I wanted something different, even though I miss windows.
Yes, the MBP is more expensive than competing PC laptops.##expensive -1
Apple no longer includes iDVD with the computer and furthermore, Apple doesn't even offer it anymore!
I also wanted Windows 7, which this one has.
At first, I feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the Mac system.##uncomfortable -1
I am used to computers with windows so I am having a little difficulty finding my way around.
They replaced it and so far so good.##good +1
It just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the OS.##out of the box +1, cool +1
Good in every aspect.##Good +1
its as advertised on here..... it works great and is not a waste of money!##great +1
Replaced this one with my mac that was stolen, its a great computer.##great +1
Just be careful; you always have to give up some good stuff for others.
Runs like a champ.....
Really great ... Well let me start at the beginning.##great +1
Premium price for the OS more than anything else.##Premium +1
This was a gift for my grand son.
I was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews, but I've found it fine to work with.##fine +1
I bought this Mac book pro along with a new 27" iMac and while they are still light years more reliable than a PC I have noticed a decline in the reliability of my Mac computers.
The sound as mentioned earlier isn't the best, but it can be solved with headphones.##best +1
The track pad is a bit squirrely at times- sometimes too sensitive, and sometimes a bit unresponsive, but it's usable.##squirrely -1, too sensitive -1, unresponsive -1, usable +1
However, the experience was great since the OS does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen.##great +1, unstable -1
Then only FOUR months later, my great MacBook pro FAILED.##FAILED -1
If you ask me, for this price it should be included.
The battery is not as shown in the product photos.
Even though I could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price I still think there's nothing like a Mac.
Seems a much more economical way to get into Apple than their other computers.##economical +1
Shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more...##quick +1
I'm so disgusted that I wasted my money on this product.##disgusted -1, wasted -1
All you get is a box and a computer.
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping.
Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i've had it.
The Mac Mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there.##simplest +1
Instead, I'll focus more on the actual performance and feature set of the hardware itself so you can make an educated decision on which Mac to buy.
My bag just got a little lighter.##lighter +1
I'm Not exaggerating when I say this computer is perfect ... It is!!##perfect +1
This machine is flawless, fast, and classy.##flawless +1, fast +1, classy +1
Other ports include FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, MagSafe port, Microphone jack.
I stayed up half the night enjoying my new MacBook Pro.##enjoying +1
This laptop is a 100 times better than a Chromebook!##better +1
Additionally, there is barely a ventilation system in the computer, and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot, and in fact impossible to keep on lap.##barely -1, hot -1, impossible -1
At $1899 to start, this is no cheap machine.
Chatting with Acer support, I was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files.##corrupted -1
It's been a couple weeks since the purchase and I'm struggle with finding the correct keys (but that was expected).
Many people complain about the new OS, and it's urgent for Apple to fix it asap!##complain -1
Now that I have upgraded to Lion I am much happier about MAC OS and have just bought an iMac for office.##happier +1
User upgradeable RAM and HDD.##upgradeable +1
But I wanted the Pro for the CD/DVD player.
I might have read it incorrectly, but better safe than sorry right?
The ultimate graduation gift.
The RAM memory is good but should have splurged for 8Mb instead of 4Mb.##good +1
was debating to buy one for months, checked out different stuff on youtube, and read different articles and debates,I just didnt really wanna spend the money but Im glad that I did.
I love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention PC's require.##love +1, recommend +1
I was a little worry at first because I don't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows.
I am an Info Sys major in college, so I started researching this issue on my own.
Solution: it turned out to be pretty simple.
With the softwares supporting the use of other OS makes it much better.##better +1
Still haven't solved this.
I then upgraded to Mac OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion".
It is EXTREMELY fast and never lags.##fast +1, never lags +1
I told them that I just received my brand new MacBook but I was having issues.##issues -1
I was considering buying the Air, but in reality, this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient, even though it's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier.##powerful +1, convenient +1, thicker -1, heavier -1
At home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24" LCD screen, so built in screen size is not terribly important.
Hopefully my replacement is brand new.
Just beware no DVD slot so when I went to install software I had on CD I couldn't.
I bought it to be able to dedicate a small, portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that I needed to buy a word processing program to do so.##small +1, portable +1, surprised -1
This version of MacBook Pro runs on a third-generation CPU ("Ivy Bridge"), not the latest fourth-generation Haswell CPU the 2013 version has.
Actually, I think I was intimidated by the change from a PC.
No Cd Rom in the new version there's no way I'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version.##less -1
Definitely worth spending the money on it.##worth +1
I have three words: Piece of Junk!
the volume is really low to low for a laptop was not expecting volume to be so low and i hate that about this computer##low -1, hate -1
Fits all my personal needs.##Fits +1
I'm the pro-active type so I went off and did some preventative fixes.
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it.##recommend +1
I wanted to explore what the Mac was all about.
I got this at an amazing price from Amazon and it arrived just in time.##amazing +1
Every time I log into the system after a few hours, there is this endlessly frustrating process that I have to go through.##frustrating -1
The majority of the reviews seem to be for the 13.3 MacBook Pro  Model # MD101LL/A.
Put a SSD and use a 21" LED screen, this set up is silky smooth!##silky smooth +1
I saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from Apple and I was concerned but I took my chances and am overly impressed.##impressed +1
The case is now slightly larger than the previous generation, but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size.##larger -1, lack -1
I had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it, as I am old school and hate the pad, but knew that before I bought it, now it works great, need to get adjusted to the key board, as I am used to a bigger one and pounding.##hate -1, great +1
When considering a Mac, look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag.
Has all the other features I wanted including a VGA port, HDMI, ethernet and 3 USB ports.
A great college tool!##great +1
The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip.##dislike -1
I called apple and no solution.
It's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time.##decent +1
I was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon.com than it was in the Mac store.##happy +1, better +1
The worst a Mac ever did to me was freeze up.##worst -1, freeze up -1
The nicest  part is the low heat output and ultra quiet operation.##nicest +1, quiet +1
I am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet.
NO STAR FOR THIS TRASH.[...
I will upgrade the ram myself (because with this model you can you can do it) later on.
The price is 200 dollars down.
this Mac Mini does not have a built-in mic, and it would seem that its Mac OS 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly.
A lot of features and shortcuts on the MBP that I was never exposed to on a normal PC.
Wasn't sure if I was going to like it much less love it so I went to a local best buy and played around with the IOS system on a Mac Pro and it was totally unique and different.##unique +1, different +1
Quietest laptop I have ever owned.##Quietest +1
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small.##higher +1, small -1
again this is just my personal honest opinion.
If you have much higher expectations than that... I would look elsewhere.
working with Mac is so much easier, so many cool features.##easier +1, cool +1
I'm going to buy a logitech c270.
Very happy with my purchase.##happy +1
I like the brightness and adjustments.##like +1
I'M SO HAPPY WITH MY macbook pro!##HAPPY +1
I only wish this mac had a CD/DVD player built in.##wish -1
The only thing I miss is that my old Alienware laptop had backlit keys.##miss -1
The only thing I miss are the "Home/End" type keys and other things that I grew accustomed to after so long.##miss -1
So happy with this purchase, I just wish it came with Microsoft Word.##happy +1
It is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student.##more than enough +1
It has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop.##enough +1
The speed, the simplicity, the design.. it is light-years ahead of any PC I have ever owned.
I love everything about this computer.##love +1
I found it toughest to decide between Dell ultra books and Apple.
The battery life is excellent, the display is excellent, and downloading apps is a  breeze.##excellent +1, excellent +1, breeze +1
The screen, the software and the smoothness of the operating system.
While we struggle with all the crashes and viruses, the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for business!##consistent +1
I don't want to RUN a computer; I want to USE a computer.
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it.
I also made a recovery USB stick.
Being a PC user for many years to switch to a Mac I will not go back.
But with this laptop, the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny.##weak -1, tinny -1
I do admit it is pricey but the saying is really true with this MacBook Pro Laptop ( You get what you pay for).##pricey -1
I've almost have bought every generation of MacMinis since 2005, and this one hasn't let me down.
The built quality is really good, I was so Happy and excited about this Product.##good +1, Happy +1, excited +1
I am loving the fast performance also.##loving +1, fast +1
I had to return it because it wouldn't even start.
Further, this Mac Mini has a sloppy Bluetooth interface (courtesy of the Mac OS) and the range is poor.##sloppy -1, poor -1
Great deal on an amazing lap top!##Great +1, amazing +1
If you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the start menu will automatically come up.
Best money I ever spent.##Best +1
My only gripe would be the need to add more RAM.
But I didn't want to spend another thousand on a laptop since my work already provides me with a PC.
Fine if you have a touch screen.
can never go wrong with apple products.
As far as user type - I dabble in everything from games (WoW) to Photoshop, but nothing professionally.
It doesnt get hot like my PC, with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime I forget how to do something i just google it.##hot -1
I re-seated the "WLAN" card inside and re-installed the LAN device drivers.
This by far beats any computer out on the market today built well, battery life AMAZING.##beats +1, well +1, AMAZING +1
I haven't used it for anything high tech yet, but I love it already.##love +1
The OS is easy, and offers all kinds of surprises.##easy +1
I had to get Apple Customer Support to correct the problem.
Ideal for someone on the go or for a high school students.
A very important feature is Firewire 800 which in my experience works better then USB3 (in PC enabled with USB3)I was not originally sold on the MAC OS I felt it was inferior in many ways To Windows 7.##better +1, inferior -1
I like iTunes, the apparent security, the Mini form factor, all the nice graphics stuff.##like +1, apparent +1, nice +1
The first time I used the card reader it took half an hour and a pair of tweezers to remove the card.
This flaw unfortunately detracts from everything else Apple got right with the Mini.
After replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive, my mac is just flying.
I know some people complained about HDMI issues but they released a firmware patch to address that issue.##complained -1
With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs.##best +1
Added an iMac about 2 years later.
packing and everything was perfect##perfect +1
I will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends##recommend +1
I called Toshiba where I gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards.##issues -1
I seem to be having repeat problems as the Mother Board in this one is diagnosed as faulty, related to the graphics card.##faulty -1
It also comes with 4G of RAM but if you're like me you want to max that out so I immediately put 8G of RAM in her and I've never used a computer that performs better.##better +1
This computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling.##awesome +1
Cost is more as compared to other brands.##more -1
also...- excellent operating system- size and weight for optimal mobility- excellent durability of the battery- the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand-##excellent +1, optimal +1, excellent +1, unmatched +1
This hardware seems to be better than the iMac in that it isn't $1400 and smaller.##better +1, smaller +1
I'm done with WinDoze computers.
I've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates.
the latest version does not have a disc drive.
Screen - although some people might complain about low res which I think is ridiculous.
